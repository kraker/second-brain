Successful teams do these 2 things:

1. Track and organize **work in progress (WIP)**
2. Eliminate 2 biggest **time sinkholes**:
   + Operating System (OS) installation
   + Software deployment

Turn things around by doing the following: 

* **Track and control WIP**
* **Automate OS installation**
* **Adopt CI/CD for software pushes**
  + Outside of Jeff's oneliners, MH failed in this area. We probably could have
    automated common software deploys with something like Ansible. 

## Managing WIP

1. Ticketing system
