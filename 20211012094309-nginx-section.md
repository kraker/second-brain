This seems incomplete. All that's here is a link to our UltraStack setup. 

I think our UltraStack setup should be introduced in the official APS training
since it's proprietary to our hosting. 

A more general intro to Nginx, tools, and troubleshooting would be appropriate
for APS pipeline. 

I think understanding how to build a LAMP is probably in the scope of the APS
pipeline. 

If I were to think of a lab we might use for introducing Nginx, it would be
installing and setting Nginx as a reverse proxy. But that might be a bit
advanced and more in the scope of the T2S/MH pipeline. 

This may be worth some discussion.
