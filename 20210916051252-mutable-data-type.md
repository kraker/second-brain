A **mutable data type** is a type of data can by changed. Lists for example.
Data within a list can be changed, rearranged, removed, etc. Strings are one
example of an immutable data type.

New strings can be built with _slicing and dicing_ (then putting the pieces back
together) but your building a new string and the original string stays the same.
