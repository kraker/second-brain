A **local area network (LAN)** is a 
[computer network](20210610054021-computer-network.md) that
interconnects computers within a limited area such as a residence, school,
laboratory, university campus or office building. By contrast, a 
[wide area network](20201017170819-wan.md) (WAN) not only covers a
larger geographic distance, but also generally involves 
[leased telecommunication circuits](20210626075326-leased-line.md).

Most common types of LAN currently still in use:
* [Ethernet](20201012135112-ethernet.md)
* [Wi-Fi](20210626075555-wi-fi.md)
