## Buying NICs
Buy name-brand.

## Installation
* Commonly installed in [PCI](2020-10-19--13-57-29Z--pci.md) or [PCIe](2020-10-19--13-58-29Z--pcie.md) slot on motherboard.
* Can get [USB](2020-10-19--13-59-44Z--usb.md) NICs

### Drivers
Usually NICs will come with a CD or have downloadable drivers
* Often the drivers are already baked into an OS

## Bonding
Most [switches](2020-10-14--13-51-36Z--switch.md) enable you to use multiple NICs for a single machine, a process called *bonding* or *link aggregation*.
* This can effectively double (or more) the speed between switch and machine.
* Best to use identical NICs if this is going to be done

## Link Lights
All [UTP](2020-10-14--13-39-56Z--utp.md) NICs have some type of [LED](2020-10-13--12-53-41Z--led.md) that indicates if connection is good and if it's working.
* Link Light
	Solid, on if working
* Activity Light
	Flashes intermittently when detects network activity
* Collision Light
	Some older NICs have this, not found on modern network equipment

* Multispeed Devices
Use multiple colers to differentiate between speed of connection
* Orange = commonly [10BaseT](2020-10-14--13-10-29Z--10baset.md) or [100BaseT](2020-10-17--15-57-14Z--100baset.md)
* Green = commonly [1 GbE](2020-10-17--16-22-40Z--1000baset.md)
