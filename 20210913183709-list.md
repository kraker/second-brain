* A **list** is just like it sounds. A list of things in sequence. 
* A _list value_ is a list.
* A list can be stored in a [variable](20210910202050-variables.md) or passed to a 
[function](20210912120056-functions.md).

Example list:

```python
['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
```

* Values inside the list are called _items_
* Items are _comma-delimited_
* This is an empty list: `[]`
