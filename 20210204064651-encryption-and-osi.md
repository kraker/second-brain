* **Layer 1**					No common encryption is done on this layer
* **Layer 2**					No common encryption is done on this layer	
* **Layer 3**					IPsec - typically implemented by software
* **Layer 4**					Neither TCP nor UDP offers any encryption methods
* **Layers 5, 6, 7**	Important encryption standards (SSL/TLS) happen on these
											layers, but don't fit cleanly into the OSI model.
