## SSL
_Secure Sockets Layer_

* Process:
	1. Client requests access to an SSL-secured server
	2. Server sends the client a copy of the [SSL Certificate](20210205074022-ssl-certificate.md)
	3. The SSL client checks the certificate against CA roots
	4. Client negotiates a 
		 [symmetric-key cipher](20210203072917-symmetric-key-encryption.md)
		 for use in the session
	5. Session is now secure with an encrypted tunnel
* SSL is limited to [HTML](20201110145200-html.md),
	[FTP](20201112150625-ftp.md), [SMTP](20201111155243-smtp.md),
	and a few older TCP applications.

## TLS
_Transport Layer Security_

Designed as an upgrade to _SSL_.

* Used to secure a variety of TCP/IP applications including
	[VOIP](20201021125745-voip.md), [VPN](20210205074906-vpn.md),
	[HTTPS](20201110150126-https.md), and EAP-TLS (wireless networking).
