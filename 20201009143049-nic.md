## Buying NICs
Buy name-brand.

## Installation
* Commonly installed in [PCI](20201019135729-pci.md) or [PCIe](20201019135829-pcie.md) slot on motherboard.
* Can get [USB](20201019135944-usb.md) NICs

### Drivers
Usually NICs will come with a CD or have downloadable drivers
* Often the drivers are already baked into an OS

## Bonding
Most [switches](20201014135136-switch.md) enable you to use multiple NICs for a single machine, a process called *bonding* or *link aggregation*.
* This can effectively double (or more) the speed between switch and machine.
* Best to use identical NICs if this is going to be done

## Link Lights
All [UTP](20201014133956-utp.md) NICs have some type of [LED](20201013125341-led.md) that indicates if connection is good and if it's working.
* Link Light
	Solid, on if working
* Activity Light
	Flashes intermittently when detects network activity
* Collision Light
	Some older NICs have this, not found on modern network equipment

* Multispeed Devices
Use multiple colers to differentiate between speed of connection
* Orange = commonly [10BaseT](20201014131029-10baset.md) or [100BaseT](20201017155714-100baset.md)
* Green = commonly [1 GbE](20201017162240-1000baset.md)
