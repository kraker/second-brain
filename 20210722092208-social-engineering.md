**Social engineering** is the process of using or manipulating people inside the
networking environment to gain access to that network from the outside.

## Phishing

**Phishing** is when the attacker poses as some sort of trusted site online in
order to steal information.

## Physical Intrusion

A person is able to physically gain access to your network. Walking away from a
server while still logged in leaves room for _physical intrusion_ into your
network.
