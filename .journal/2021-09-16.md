Creating your own key mappings as needed is better than those that are pre-built
for you. Doom Emacs is an example. If you build them yourself as needed they
grow organically and you remember them better.

Today I felt really emotional. I wonder if it correlates with yesterday's
session? I also wonder if I tend to suppress my emotions and if that's why I get
depressed? If that's the case it makes sense that when I'm becoming less
depressed I would feel some of those emotions that I was suppressing.
