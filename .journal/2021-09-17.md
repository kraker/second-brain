Coming out of depression is like waking up from a bad dream.

I feel really sad.

I also have a lot of regrets.

I regret all of the lost time.

I feel like I've been a bad friend,
a bad sibling,
a bad housemate,
and a bad pet owner.

I miss making music.

I feel like I was trying to bury this part of me that hurts to much to
acknowledge.

There's a lot of pain now that I'm less depressed.
