  software support, mobile phones, server, online services the company uses, 
  defining policies, etc
* General documentation: do not improve until you understand the environment (do 
  backup before change)
* Crucial services inventory: Identify mission critical services and where they 
  are hosted; identify who is responsible for them if its not you
* [DR] Disaster Recovery Plan: Backups are running properly? Backup rotation? 
  Last DR test? Automated? In case of my absence?
* [BC] Business Continuity Plan
* [BIA] Business Impact Analysis
* Network topology: configuration (backup?), passwords, routers, gateways, 
  subnets, vlans, static addresses, dhcp, labeled cables
* Power supply/UPS
* ISP: contact, agreements, SLA, contracts, circuit numbers
* Support for environment's components: contact, agreements, consultants, SLA, 
  contracts; renew/remedy any issues regarding lack of support, get replacement 
  parts in a timely fashion, maintenance contract situation

  custom exclusions

* Crisis kit: fire safe place, vendor contacts, emergency numbers, screwdriver, 
  towel, deodorant, phone charger, headache medication, cable tester, takeout 
  menu
* Meetings: with heads of departmentswhat their team does, what they use, what 
  their major issues are
* Make a "Small wins": list that you can fix that will give you a bit of face to 
  work with - this will contribute to people trusting that you're a professional 
  there to provide a service.

### 3 -- Changes

* Budget: now and in the future; limit extra useless PCs/laptops
* Categorize tickets: for future analyzing
* Monitoring software: Icinga (or other software); iLo/iDrac sending mails; 
  enable smart monitoring on disks, UPSes
