What is a frame?

## Answer
Container for a chunk of data as it moves across the network.
[NIC](20201009143049-nic.md)s create and send as well as receive and read frames.

## Generic Frame
| Destination | Source      | Type | Data | FCS |
| MAC address | MAC address |      |      |     |
_Usually holds at most 1500 bytes of data._

* Preamble
	*See below*
* [MAC address](20201009143255-mac-address.md)
* Type
	Identifies data encoding at a very basic level. IPv4 vs IPv6, for example.
* Data
	Whatever payload the frame carries. IP [packet](20201010182424-packet.md) for example
* Pad
	The minimum Ethernet frame is 64 bytes. If a frame has fewer than 64 bytes of
	data the sending NIC will automatically add extra data.
* FCS
	+ **FCS:** Frame Check Sequence
	+ 4 bytes long
	+ Uses CRC to check the integrity of the data
	+ **CRC:** cyclic redundancy check

## Unicast frame
Any frame specifically addressed to another device's MAC address.
*unicast addressing*

## [Ethernet frame](20210626072017-ethernet-frame.md) 
Same basic fields as the *generic frame*.
* Transmission starts with a *preamble* and can also include extra filler
* called a pad.
* **preamble:** 7-byte series of alternating 1s and 0s followed by a 1-byte
	*start frame delimiter*.
