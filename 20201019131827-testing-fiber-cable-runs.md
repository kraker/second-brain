# Fiber Challenges

-   Signal Loss/Degradation
-   Damaged cables or open connections
-   Dirty connector
-   [Attenuation](20201019133004-attenuate.md)
-   Bend radius limiatation
    -   If you bend a cable too much it causes light leakage.

# Physical or Signal Mismatch

-   Connector or transceiver incompatibility
-   Cable incompatibility

# Fiber Tools

-   **OTDR:** Optical Time Domain Reflectometer
    -   Tells you how far down the wire the cable is broken

# 3 big issues

-   Attenuation
-   Light Leakage
-   Modal distortion
