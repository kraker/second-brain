A **medium dependent interface (MDI)** describes the interface (both physical
and electrical/optical) in a [computer network](20210610054021-computer-network.md) 
from a physical layer implementation to the physical medium used to carry the
transmission. [Ethernet over twisted pair](20201012135035-twisted-pair.md) 
also defines a **medium dependent interface crossover** (MDI-X) interface.
**Auto MDI-X** ports on newer network interfaces detect if the connection would
require a crossover, and automatically chooses the MDI or MDI-X configuration to
properly match the other end of the link.
