# Overview

# Installation

Pandoc is free open source software. This utility is available for Windows and
most major Linux distrobutions. Please review the official documentation for how
to [install](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) this software for your OS. 

# Getting started

Pandoc is a command-line tool. There is no graphic user interface. In order to
use it, [open a
terminal](https://pandoc.org/getting-started.html#step-2-open-a-terminal). 

Verify that Pandoc is installed:
```
pandoc --version
```

## Basic Usage

Pandoc can be used as a command-line interpretor.  Pandoc can take input that's
written in a syntax that it recognizes and convert it to another syntax.  By
default pandoc interprets input as Markdown and output as HTML. 

To open the Pandoc interpretor just type `pandoc` into your terminal and press
**Enter**:

```
[akraker@localhost ~]$ pandoc
Hello *pandoc*!

- one
- two
```

In the above example, Markdown is typed into the terminal. Once complete use
Ctrl-D and then **Enter** to signify the End of File (EOF) in a Linux
environment or use Ctrl-Z + **Enter** in a Windows environment. 

The above example will convert your Markdown into HTML like this:
```
<p>Hello <em>pandoc</em>!</p>
<ul>
<li>one</li>
<li>two</li>
</ul>
```

Where pandoc really shines is it's ability to take a file written in one syntax
and convert it to another syntax. To do this via the CLI:
```
pandoc -f markdown -t mediawiki /path/to/file.md
```

Where `-f` is the input file syntax and `-t` is the output file syntax. Here's
an example using this article:

```
[akraker@localhost wiki_articles]$ pandoc -f markdown -t mediawiki pandoc.md | head

== Installation ==

Pandoc is free open source software. This utility is available for Windows and most major Linux distrobutions. Please review the official documentation for how to [https://pandoc.org/installing.html install] this software for your OS.

== Getting started ==
```

You'll notice that by default pandoc will convert your file and output the
result to the terminal. In most cases it's most useful to just redirect this
output directly to a file. 

```
pandoc -f markdown -t mediawiki pandoc.md > pandoc.mediawik
```
or pandoc has a flag for writing output to a file as well
```
pandoc test1.md -f markdown -t html -s -o test1.html
```

## Advanced Usage

started](https://pandoc.org/getting-started.html#step-2-open-a-terminal) guide,
