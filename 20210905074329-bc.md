An arbitrary precision calculator language bc is written in it's own
C-like language Can read from files or stdin like most utilities

running from a file
``` c
/* A very simple bc script */
2 + 2
```
```bash
[me@linuxbox ~]$ bc foo.bc
bc 1.06.94

bc can be used interactively

``` bash
[me@linuxbox ~]$ bc -q
2 + 2
4
quit
```

It's also possible to pass a script to bc via stdin `bc < foo.bc`

The ability to accept stdin means that we can use here docs: `bc <<<
"2+2"`

``` bash
#!/bin/bash

# loan-calc: script to calculate monthly loan payments

PROGNAME="${0##*/}" # Use parameter expansion to get basename

usage () {
    cat <<- EOF
    Usage: $PROGNAME PRINCIPAL INTEREST MONTHS
    Where:
    PRINCIPAL is the amount of the loan.
    INTEREST is the APR as a number (7% = 0.07).
    MONTHS is the length of the loan's term.
    EOF
}

if (($# != 3)); then
    usage
    exit 1
fi

principal=$1
interest=$2
months=$3

bc <<- EOF
    scale = 10
    i = $interest / 12
    p = $principal
    n = $months
    a = p * ((i * ((1 + i) ^ n)) / (((1 + i) ^ n) - 1))
    print a, "\n"
EOF 
```

``` bash
[me@linuxbox ~]$ loan-calc 135000 0.0775 180
1270.7222490000 
```
