**Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)** is a security protocol used in the [IEEE 802.11](2021-06-26--15-18-26Z--ieee_80211.md)
wireless networking standard.

* TKIP developed to replace [WEP](2021-06-13--07-04-02Z--wired_equivalent_privacy.md) 
  without requiring the replacement of legacy hardware.
* TKIP is no longer considered secure and was deprecated in 2012.
