**Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)** is a security protocol used in the [IEEE 802.11](20210626151826-ieee-80211.md)
wireless networking standard.

* TKIP developed to replace [WEP](20210613070402-wired-equivalent-privacy.md) 
  without requiring the replacement of legacy hardware.
* TKIP is no longer considered secure and was deprecated in 2012.
