Have images of broken containers that can be spun up as needed which fit a
scenario like Apache being broken, or a MySQL issue.

Tie the OpenStack labs into a Udemy course. 
Integrate into Moodle site?

* Gave APS pipeline review notes
* We need to get training on board with introducing the wiki
* Can't use udemy for pipeline.
* Sounds like we could open-source the pipeline code, would be supported by
leadership. 
* Train PCI compliance. 
* Fix incentive structure; we need to reward technical expertise and resolving
issues correctly. PCI compliance is the perfect example of something that's
discouraged to resolve because of the time that it takes to do correctly. 

### Tasks

- [ ] Review PCI compliance wiki
- [ ] Finish review of APS pipeline

## 2021-10-14

* Unlikely to get a lot of buy-in from training.
