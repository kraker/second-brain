**Code-division multiple access (CDMA)** is a channel access method used by
various radio communication technologies. CDMA is an example of multiple access,
where several transmitters can send information simultaneously over a single
communication channel. This allows several users to share a band of frequencies
(see [bandwidth](20210613080922-bandwidth.md)). To permit this without 
undue interference between the users, CDMA employs spread spectrum technology
and a special coding scheme (where each transmitter is assigned a code).

CDMA optimizes the use of available bandwidth as it transmits over the entire
frequency range and does not limit the user's frequency range.
