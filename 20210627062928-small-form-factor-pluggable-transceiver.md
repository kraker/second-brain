The **small form-factor pluggable (SPF)** is a compact, hot-pluggable network
interface module used for both [telecommunication](20210625060256-telecommunications.md) 
and [data communications](20210626092621-data-communication.md)
applications.

A slightly larger sibling is the four-lane **Quad Small Form-factor Pluggable (QSFP)**.
