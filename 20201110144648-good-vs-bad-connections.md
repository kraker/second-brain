# Rules for determining good vs bad connections

1.  Memorize a bunch of known ports for common TCP/IP applications
2.  Learn how to use `netstat` with switches `-a -n -o -b` to help define what you're looking for
3.  Take the time to learn the ports that run on your OS
4.  Learn processes that normally run on your OS
5.  Search for info on processes you don't recognize
6.  Get rid of bad processes
