In computer networking, the **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)** is one of the core
members of the [Internet protocol suite](20210615061915-internet-protocol-suite.md). With UDP, computer applications can send
messages, in this case referred to as _datagrams_, to other hosts on an
[Internet Protocol](20201010175903-internet-protocol.md) (IP) network.
Prior communications are not required in order to set up communication channels
or paths. 

UDP uses a simple [connectionless communication](20210615061227-connectionless-communication.md) 
model with a minimum of protocol mechanisms.

**UDP datagram**
| Destination | Source | Length | Checksum | Data |
| port        | port   |        |          |      |

_Lacks most of extra fields found in [TCP segments](20201011174727-tcp-segment.md), 
since it's [connectionless](20201011173345-connection-vs-connectionless.md)._

* Best for transmitting lots of data where dropped frames won't make much difference
* Really fast compared to [TCP](20201010181222-tcp.md).
* [DNS](20201021131818-dns.md) and
	[DHCP](20201021131828-dhcp.md) are two examples that use UDP
