## SSL
_Secure Sockets Layer_

* Process:
	1. Client requests access to an SSL-secured server
	2. Server sends the client a copy of the [SSL Certificate](2021-02-05--07-40-22Z--ssl_certificate.md)
	3. The SSL client checks the certificate against CA roots
	4. Client negotiates a 
		 [symmetric-key cipher](2021-02-03--07-29-17Z--symmetric-key_encryption.md)
		 for use in the session
	5. Session is now secure with an encrypted tunnel
* SSL is limited to [HTML](2020-11-10--14-52-00Z--html.md),
	[FTP](2020-11-12--15-06-25Z--ftp.md), [SMTP](2020-11-11--15-52-43Z--smtp.md),
	and a few older TCP applications.

## TLS
_Transport Layer Security_

Designed as an upgrade to _SSL_.

* Used to secure a variety of TCP/IP applications including
	[VOIP](2020-10-21--12-57-45Z--voip.md), [VPN](2021-02-05--07-49-06Z--vpn.md),
	[HTTPS](2020-11-10--15-01-26Z--https.md), and EAP-TLS (wireless networking).
