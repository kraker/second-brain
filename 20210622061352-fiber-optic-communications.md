**Fiber-optic communication** is a method of transmitting information from one
place to another by sending pulses of infrared light through an 
[Optical fiber](20210618074911-optical-fiber.md). The light is a form of
[carrier wave](20210622061559-carrier-wave.md) that is 
[modulated](20210622061654-modulated.md) to carry information. Fiber is
preferrred over electrical cabling when high [bandwidth](20210622062329-bandwidths.md), 
long distance, or immunity to [electromagnetic interference](20201012133139-emi.md) is required.
