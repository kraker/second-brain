The **elif statement** is an "else if" statement following either an [if statement](20210911074717-if-statements.md)
or another elif statement. It's [condition](20210911072918-conditions.md) is
checked only if all previous conditions were _False_.

An elif statement consists of the following:

* The _elif_ keyword
* A condition
* A colon
* Starting on the next line, an indented block of code

```python
if name == 'Alice':
    print('Hi, Alice.')
elif age < 12:
    print('You are not Alice, kiddo.')
else:
    print('Hello, stranger.')
```

_elif_ statements can be in a chain. If an elif statement condition is _True_
all of the statements following it in the chain are skipped. Order does matter.
