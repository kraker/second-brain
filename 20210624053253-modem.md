A **modulator-demodulator**, or simply a **modem**, is a 
[hardware](20210624054410-computer-hardware.md) device that converts
data from a digital format, intended for communication directly between devices
with specialized wiring, into one suitable for a 
[transmission medium](20210624054607-transmission-medium.md) such as
telephone lines or radio. A modem [modulates](20210622061654-modulated.md)
one or more [carrier wave](20210622061559-carrier-wave.md) signals to
encode [digital information](20210624051337-digital-data.md) for
transmission, and [demodulates](20210624054922-demodulation.md) signals
to decode the transmitted information. The goal is to produce a
[signal](20210624055243-signal.md) that can be transmitted easily and
decoded reliably to reproduce the original digital data.
