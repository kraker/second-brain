# SELinux

_Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux)_

SELinux is an implementation of [Mandatory Access Control](20250821203751-mac.md) (MAC) developed by the [National Security Agency](20250821214131-nsa.md) (NSA).

## Terminology

* **Subject:** Any user or process that accesses an _object_.
* **Object:** A resource such as a file, dir, hw device, network interface, etc
* **Access:** Action performed by the _subject_ on an _object_
* **Policy:** A defined ruleset enforced system-wide
* **Context** (a.k.a label): A tag that stores security attributes for _subjects_ and _objects_.
* **Labeling:** A mapping of files with their stored _contexts_.
* **SELinux User:** Predefined user identities that are authorized for particular _roles_.
* **Role (RBAC):** Classifies what subjects (who) are allowed to access what _domains_ or _types_.
* **Type enforcement (TE):** Limits a _subjects_ access to _domains_ for processes and _types_ for files.
* **Type:** A group of _objects_ (files, dirs, ect.) that share the same _context_.
* **Domain:** Determines what access processes have (context they're allowed to run in).
* **Level (MLS and MCS):** _sensitivity:category_ values that defines the level of security in the _context_.
