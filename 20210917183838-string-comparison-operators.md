| Expression         | Is True Ifâ€¦                                                                                                                                                                         |

| -n string          | The length of string is greater than zero                                                                                                                                           |

| string1 = string2  | *string1* and *string2* are equal. Single or double                                                                                                                                 |
| string1 == string2 | equal signs may be used. The use of double equal                                                            signs is supported by bash and is preferred, but is not POSIX compliant |

| string1 < string2  | *string1* sorts before *string2* *Note: the **>** and **<** must be escaped or quoted when used with test or they will be interpreted by the shell as redirect operators.*          |
