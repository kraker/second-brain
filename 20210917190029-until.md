Does the opposite of `while` and continues until true

Example

``` bash
#!/bin/bash
                                                      
# until-count: display a series of numbers
                                                      
count=1
until [[ "$count" -gt 5 ]]; do
    echo "$count"
    count=$((count + 1))
done
echo "Finished."
```
