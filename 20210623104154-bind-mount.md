A **bind mount** is a specific type of [mount](20210623104256-mount.md).

**Example:**
```
mount --bind /some/where /else/where
mount -o bind /some/where /else/where
```

Unlike a hard link or symbolic link, a bind mount doesn't affect what is stored
on the filesystem. It's a property of the live system.
