The **Big Five personality traits** uses factor analysis applied to personality
survey data to identify 5 key areas of differentiation between personality
types. This is the only theory of personality that seems to have stood up to
rigorous statistical and research scrutiny (<- my own thoughts on the subject).

## 5 Key Factors

Mnemonics: **OCEAN** or **CANOE**

* **Extraversion:** outgoing/energetic vs. solitary reserved
* **Agreeableness:** friendly/compassionate vs. critical/rational
* **Openness to experience:** inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious
* **Conscientiousness:** efficient/organized vs. extravagant/careless
* **Neuroticism:** sensitive/nervous vs. resilient/confident

## Heritability vs Learned Behavior

* Upbringing affects these traits. 
* Twins studies and other research shows that 1/2 the variation between
	individuals results from genetic factors and 1/2 from environmental factors.
* Resarch shows that _Big 5_ are relatively stable from middle age through old
age.
