## RHCSA Notes

## Books

* [Red Hat RHCSA 9 Cert Guide EX200](https://www.sandervanvugt.com/red-hat-rhcsa-9-cert-guide-ex200/) by Sander Van Vugt
  Good source. Sander Van Vugt's courses are considered the defacto standard for prep for this exam. This source has better study materials and a pre-assessment exam which I like.
* [RHCSA Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9: Training and Exam Preparation Guide (EX200), Third Edition](https://www.amazon.com/RHCSA-Red-Hat-Enterprise-Linux/dp/1775062163) by Asghar Ghori
  Ok source. I wish I had started with the other one though...

## Courses

* [RHCSA RHEL 9 Complete Video Course](https://www.sandervanvugt.com/course/rhcsa-rhel-9-complete-video-course/) by Sander Van Vugt
  I didn't buy the course since I tend to prefer books over video lecture style courses. But this is considered by many to be the defacto standard when it comes to studying for the RHCSA exams. The book above comes with a pretty significant discount, so I recommend buying the book for the coupon.

## Platforms

* [RHCSA Guru](https://rhcsa.guru/)
  I haven't tried this yet, but hands-on labs may be worth the price of admission. Similar concept to A Cloud Guru...
