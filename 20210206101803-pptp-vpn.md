_Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol_
Microsoft advanced version of [PPP](20210205061226-ppp.md) that handles
the connection right out of the box.
* Places the _PPTP_ endpoints on the client and server
* The server endpoint is a remote access server program on a Windows server,
	called _Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS)_. 
* On the Windows client side you run **Add a VPN Connection** in Settings in the
	Control Panel. 
	+ This creates a virtual NIC, does a DHCP query and gets an IP address from
		the DHCP server on the private network. 
* Every OS comes with some type of built-in VPN client that supports PPTP
* This type of connection where a single computer becomes a member of that
	remote network is called a _host-to-site connection_.
