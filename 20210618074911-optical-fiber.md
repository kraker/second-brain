An **optical fiber** is a flexible, transparent fiber made by drawing glass
(silica) or plastic to a diameter slightly thicker than that of a human hair.
Optical fibers are used most often as a means to transmit light between the two
ends of the fiber and find wide usage in 
[fiber-optic communications](20210622061352-fiber-optic-communications.md), where
they permit transmission over longer distances and at higher
[bandwidths](20210622062329-bandwidths.md) (data transfer rates) than
electrical cables.
