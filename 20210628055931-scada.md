**Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)** is a 
[Control system](20210628060107-control-system.md)
architecture comprising [computers](20210628060404-computer.md), 
networked data communications and 
[graphical user interface](20210628060543-graphical-user-interface.md) (GUI) 
for high-level process supervisory management, while also
comprising other [peripheral](20210628060646-peripheral.md) devices like 
[programmable logic controllers](20210628060734-programmable-logic-controller.md) (PLC)
and discrete 
[proportional-integral-derivative](20210628060850-pid-controller.md) (PID) 
controllers to interface
with process plant or machinery. The use of SCADA has been considered also for
management and operations of project-driven-process in construction.
