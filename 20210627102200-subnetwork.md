A **subnetwork** or **subnet** is a logical subdivision of an 
[IP network](20210615061915-internet-protocol-suite.md). The practice of
dividing a network into two or more networks is called 
[subnetting](20201026134500-subnetting.md).

* Devices in the same subnet share the same _network number_ or _routing prefix_
	+ In technical terms this is known as the 
		[most significant bit](20210627111350-most-significant-bit.md)-group
		in their [IP Addresses](20201010180322-ip-address.md)
	+ In layman terms this can also be considered the 
		[network ID](20201026125117-network-id.md)
* The the second field (_suffix_) is considered the _rest field_ or _host
	identifier_
* The _routing prefix_ may be experessed in 
	[Classless Inter-Domain Routing](20201026134351-cidr.md) (CIDR)
		+ **Example:** `198.51.100.0/24` or `2001:db8::/32`
* For [IPv4](20201021124014-ipv4.md) a network may be characterized by
	its **subnet mask** or **netmask**:
	+ This is the [bitmask](20210627112414-mask-computing.md) that when
		applied by a [bitwise AND](20210627112537-bitwise-operation.md)
		operation to any IP address in the network, yields the _routing prefix_.
		- Usually expressed in [dot-decimal notation](20210627112934-dot-decimal-notation.md). 
			For example: `255.255.255.0` is the subnet mask for the prefix
			`198.51.100.0/24`
