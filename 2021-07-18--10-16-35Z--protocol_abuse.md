Anything that's a misuse or uses a networking protocol in ways it wasn't
intended to be used can be considered a _threat_.

## Common examples

### NTP attack

An attacker can spoof a source IP and submit a type of _ntpdc_ query called
_monlist_. This generates a lot of output and can effectively DoS the target
server (spoofed source IP).

### DHCP attack

Hacker can send _malformed packets_ to try to break, gain access, or shut down
the DHCP server.
