# Authentication Authorization and Accounting

_(AAA)_

* Solves many of the issues with [PPP](2021-02-05--06-12-26Z--ppp.md). 
* Is designed for the idea of _port authentication_. Allowing remote users
	authentication to a particular point of entry (a port) to another network.

* [Authentication](2021-02-03--07-04-37Z--authentication.md): authenticate with any type of authentication method, usually username and password.
* [Authorization](2021-02-03--07-06-16Z--authorization.md): once authenticated determine what it has access to.
* Accounting: the authenticating server does some form of _auditing_ logging session data, for example.
