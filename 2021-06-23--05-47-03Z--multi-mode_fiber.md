**Multi-mode optical fiber** is a type of [optical fiber](2021-06-18--07-49-11Z--optical_fiber.md)
mostly used for communication over short distances, such as within a building or
campus. Multi-mode links can be used for data rates up to 100 Gbit/s. Multi-mode
fiber has a fairly large core diameter that enables multiple light 
[modes](2021-06-23--05-59-32Z--normal_mode.md) to be propagated and limits the 
maximum length of a transmission link because of
[modal disperson](2021-06-23--05-53-06Z--modal_disperson.md).
