## Books

* [RHCSA Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9: Training and Exam Preparation Guide (EX200), Third Edition](https://www.amazon.com/RHCSA-Red-Hat-Enterprise-Linux/dp/1775062163) by Asghar Ghori
  Good source. This source is more _linux admin_ flavored, CLI-centric which I think
  more accurately reflects sysadmin day-to-day. The user is encouraged to "learn-by-doing" while following along... this is a solid approach to building muscle memory for the CLI I've found.
* [Red Hat RHCSA 9 Cert Guide EX200](https://www.sandervanvugt.com/red-hat-rhcsa-9-cert-guide-ex200/) by Sander Van Vugt
  Good source. Sander Van Vugt's courses are considered the defacto standard for prep, but I'm not sure if the book is as good as the courses... this source does seem to have better practical tips. For example, recommending using `dnf provides` to find what package needs to be installed to _provide_ a command, and what man pages to refer to rather than memorizing complex or arcane syntax, such as `semanage fcontext -a -t ...`. Some topics are not as complete and the coverage focuses on just what's needed for the exam. But exercises seem to be more relevant to what you're likely to actually encounter on the exam.

## Courses

* [RHCSA RHEL 9 Complete Video Course](https://www.sandervanvugt.com/course/rhcsa-rhel-9-complete-video-course/) by Sander Van Vugt
  I didn't buy the course since I tend to prefer books over video lecture style courses. But this is considered by many to be the defacto standard when it comes to studying for the RHCSA exams. The book above comes with a pretty significant discount, so I recommend buying the book for the coupon.

## Platforms

* [RHCSA Guru](https://rhcsa.guru/)
  I haven't tried this yet, but hands-on labs may be worth the price of admission. Similar concept to A Cloud Guru...
