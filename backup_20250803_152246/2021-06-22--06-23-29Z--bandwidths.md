In computing, **bandwidth** is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given
path. Bandwidth may be characterized as **network bandwidth**, **data
bandwidth**, or **digital bandwidth**.

This definition of _bandwidth_ is in contrast to the field of signal processing,
wireless communications, modem data transmission, digital communications, and
electronics, in which _bandwitdth_ is used to refer to analog 
[signal bandwidth](2021-06-13--08-09-22Z--bandwidth.md) measured in 
[hertz](2021-06-22--06-27-12Z--hertz.md), meaning the frequency range between
lowest and highest attainable frequency while meeting a well-defined impairment
level in signal power. The actual bit rate that can be achieved depends not only
on the signal bandwidth but also on the noise on the channel.
