## Configure PHP.ini to display all errors

Having a section on PHP errors and how to troubleshoot is a good thing to
include in the pipeline, I think. 

**Step 1**

This only works if `php.ini` is the file that's read for these configurations.
Although this isn't as common anymore, if DSO is being used, the `.htaccess`
file will be read instead. In other cases, `.user.ini` might be being read by
the PHP handler and setting the runtime environment. The best way to make sure
that you're enabling any PHP runtime environment configuration on a cPanel
server is to use the MultPHP INI Editor because it will write to any or all of
these files if they exist.
