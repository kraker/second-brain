Open-source linter

Used at Linode

* [Project](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale)

It's written in Go so it's really fast.
It requires some configuration though.

Doesn't seem to work out of the box with the [ALE](20210906095348-ale.md) plugin
for [Vim](20210906070833-vim.md) without additional config of Vale itself.
