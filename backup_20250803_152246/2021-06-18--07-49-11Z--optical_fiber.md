An **optical fiber** is a flexible, transparent fiber made by drawing glass
(silica) or plastic to a diameter slightly thicker than that of a human hair.
Optical fibers are used most often as a means to transmit light between the two
ends of the fiber and find wide usage in 
[fiber-optic communications](2021-06-22--06-13-52Z--fiber-optic_communications.md), where
they permit transmission over longer distances and at higher
[bandwidths](2021-06-22--06-23-29Z--bandwidths.md) (data transfer rates) than
electrical cables.
