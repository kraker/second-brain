* Every minute spent with a customer is deducted.
* Time spent researching an issue, specifically for one customer, is Research
	time on the customer's account.
* Time spent learning something new, even for a customer, but other customers
	will benefit, is Project time.
	+ So, the FTP issue, that's research time logged for you because the issue
		you're resolving is specific to that customer and is not likely to come up
		again for another customer.  However, learning how to install Varnish on one
		customer server is Project Time, because you'll get that request again.
