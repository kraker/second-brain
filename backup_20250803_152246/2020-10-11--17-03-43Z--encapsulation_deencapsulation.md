## Encapsulation

Encompasses the entire process of preparing data to go onto a network.
Includes all the steps from the [application](2020-10-11--16-57-07Z--layer_7.md) through [data link](2020-10-10--18-43-20Z--layer_2.md) layers.

## De-Encapsulation
This is the reverse of the encapsulation process on the receiving end.
