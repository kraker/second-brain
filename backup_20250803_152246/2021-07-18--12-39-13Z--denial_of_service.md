## Deauthentication Attack

A **deauthentication (deauth) attack** is a form of DoS attack that targets
802.11 Wi-Fi networks specifically by sending out a frame that kicks a wireless
client off it's current WAP connection. A rogue WAP nearby presents a great and
often automatic alternative option for connection. The rogue WAP connects the
client to the Internet and then proceeds to collect data from the client.

## Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack

Hundreds, thousands, or even millions of devices launch a coordinated attack
against a target host.
