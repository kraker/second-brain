An **Internet Protocol address (IP address)** is a numerical label assigned to
each device connected to a computer network that uses the 
[Internet Protocol](2020-10-10--17-59-03Z--internet_protocol.md) for
communication. An IP address serves two main functions: host or network
interface identification and location addressing.

* No 2 devices on the same network can share an IP address.
* [Routers](2020-10-10--18-08-51Z--router.md) use IP addresses not MAC addresses to forward data.
