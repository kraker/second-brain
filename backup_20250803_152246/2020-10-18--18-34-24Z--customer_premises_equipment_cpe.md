# Customer-Premises Equipment (CPE)

-   Connects to [demarc](2020-10-18--16-11-20Z--demarc.md)
    -   Cabling from demarc to CPE is called *demarc extension*
-   Acts as primary distribution point for the building
-   Often connects to a powerful switch
    -   This will then connect to a [patch panel](2020-10-18--18-01-09Z--patch_panel.md) that feeds the rest of the building
        -   This is called a *vertical cross-connect*.
