**Modal dispersion** is a distortion mechanism occurring in 
[multimode fibers](2021-06-23--05-47-03Z--multi-mode_fiber.md) and other
[waveguides](2021-06-23--05-57-46Z--waveguide.md), in which the signal is spread 
in time because the propagation velocity of the optical signal is not the same 
for all [modes](2021-06-23--05-59-32Z--normal_mode.md). Other names for this 
phenomenon include:
* **multimode distortion**
* **multimode dispersion**
* **modal distortion**
* **intermodal distortion**
* **intermodal dispersion**
* **intermodal delay distortion**
