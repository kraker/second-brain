### Options

| **Option**    | **Description**                                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| \-a array     | Assign the input to array, starting with index zero.        |
| \-d delimiter | The first character in the string *delimiter* is used to    |
|               | indicate the end of input, rather than a newline character. |
| \-e           | Use Readline to handle input. This permits input editing    |
|               | in the same manner as the command line.                     |
| \-i string    | Use *string* as default reply if the user simply presses.   |
|               | Requires the -e option.                                     |
| \-n num       | Read num characters of input, rather than an entire line.   |
| \-p prompt    | Display a prompt for input using the string prompt.         |
| \-r           | Raw mode. Do not interpret backslash characters as escapes. |
| \-s           | Silent mode. Do not echo characters to the display as they  |
|               | are typed. This is useful when inputting passwords.         |
| \-t seconds   | Timeout. Terminate input after *seconds*. Returns a         |
|               | non-zero exit status in case of timeout.                    |
| \-u fd        | Use input from the file descriptor fd, rather than          |
|               | standard input.                                             |
