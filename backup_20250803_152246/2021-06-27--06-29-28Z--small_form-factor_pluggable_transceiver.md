The **small form-factor pluggable (SPF)** is a compact, hot-pluggable network
interface module used for both [telecommunication](2021-06-25--06-02-56Z--telecommunications.md) 
and [data communications](2021-06-26--09-26-21Z--data_communication.md)
applications.

A slightly larger sibling is the four-lane **Quad Small Form-factor Pluggable (QSFP)**.
