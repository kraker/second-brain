[WAN](2020-10-17--17-08-19Z--wan.md)s are interconnected
[LAN](2020-10-26--12-52-58Z--lan.md)s. To differentiate LANs each device on a
single LAN must share a very similar, but not identical, 
[IP Address](2020-10-10--18-03-22Z--ip_address.md).

* Network ID is an IP address ending in 0
  + Can cover larger range of IPs, but having more 0s. 172.0.0.0 for example.
* All device IPs on LAN can't end in 0, but share same first octet.
  + i.e. 202.120.10.x
