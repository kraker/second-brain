Some applications query the network using this protocol; `ping` for example.

* Works at [layer 3](2020-10-10--18-44-39Z--layer_3.md) to deliver connectionless packets
* Ping works by sending *echo requests*

## Wikipedia

The **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)** is a supporting protocol in the
internet protocol suite. Is is used by network devices, including
[routers](2020-10-10--18-08-51Z--router.md), to send error messages and
operational information indicating success or failure when communicating with
another IP address, for example, an error is indicated when a requested service
is not available or that a host or router could not be reached. ICMP differes
from transport protocols such as [TCP](2020-10-10--18-12-22Z--tcp.md) and
[UDP](2020-10-11--17-36-54Z--udp.md) in that it is not typically used to
exchange data between systems, nor is it regularly employed by end-user network
applications (with the exception of some diagnostic tools like [ping](2021-06-14--06-44-11Z--ping.md) and
[traceroute](2021-06-14--06-45-32Z--traceroute.md)).
