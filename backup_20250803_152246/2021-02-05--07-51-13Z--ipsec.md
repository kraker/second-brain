_Internet Protocol Security_

An authentication and encryption protocol suite that works at the
Internet/Netwrok layer. 

* **Transport mode**
	Only the actual payload of the IP packet is encrypted: the destination and
	source IP addresses and other IP header information are still readable.
* **Tunnel mode**
	The entire IP packet is encrypted and then placed into an IPsec endpoint where
	it is encapsulated inside another IP packet. 
* Won't be widely utilized until IPv6 is in more widespread use.
* Currently only really used for creating secure tunnels between devices.

## Security architecture

IPsec uses the following protocols to perform various functions:

* [Authentication Headers](20220221080352-authentication-headers.md)
* [Encapsulating Security Payloads](20220221080412-encapsulating-security-payloads.md)
* [Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol](20211222062102-internet-security-association-and-key-management-protocol.md)
