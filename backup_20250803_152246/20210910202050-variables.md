Variables are stored with _assignment statements_.

An assignment statement consists of a variable name and an _assignment
operator_ (equal sign).

```python
spam = 42
```

Variables are _initialized_ the first time a value is stored in it. When a
variable is assigned a new value the old value is _overwritten_.

```python
>>> eggs = 'red'
>>> eggs
'red'
>>> eggs = 'green'
>>> eggs
'green'
```

## Variable Names

A good variable name describes the data it contains.

Variable names must follow these three rules:

* One word no spaces
* Only use letters, numbers and the `_` character.
* Can't begin with a number

Variables are case sensitive. It's python convention to start your variables
lowercase.

Use either camelCase or underscore_variables. PEP 8 specifies underscores, but
consistency is more important than which style you choose.

> A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds

## Variables and References

Variables store a [reference](20210916054425-references.md) to the data not the
actual data itself. References can be copied to other variables with things like

```python
spam = ['eggs', 42, 'bacon']
cheese = spam
```
