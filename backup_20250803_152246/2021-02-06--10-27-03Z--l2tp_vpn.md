_Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol_
Combined [PPTP](2021-02-06--10-18-03Z--pptp_vpn.md) and the Cisco protocol
_Layer 2 Fowarding (L2F)_ and added support to run on almost any connection
possible. 
* Cisco provides free client software to connect a single remote device to a
	Cisco VPN.
* Creates a typical _host-to-site_ or _client-to-site_ connection
* Often two Cisco VPN concentrators will connect two separate
	[LANs](2020-10-26--12-52-58Z--lan.md) permanently.
	+ It's slow but inexpensive compared to a dedicated high-speed connection
		between two faraway LANs.
