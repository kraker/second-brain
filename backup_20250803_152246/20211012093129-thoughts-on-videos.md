Like a picture is worth a 1000 words, videos can often be really helpful. But
from the standpoint of maintaining a pipeline, videos are difficult to change
once they're in place. Re-editing, re-shooting, or re-creating the video would
be time-consuming. Since we're busy sysadmins, let's be realistic, maintaining
static assets like these videos and keeping them up-to-date simply wouldn't
happen. Much like a _docs as code_ philosphy, maintaining a pipeline in a
_text-based_ format would allow for us to use a _version control system_ like
`git`,  and use a git-based work-flow like pull-requests to submit updates or
changes, or suggest improvements. This is maintainable in the long-term. Video
assets while helpful are static, don't allow for version control, and if they
become out of date, the only recourse is to just re-create them. 

Videos may be more appropriate for official APS training since they would be
maintained by the training dept. But if the pipeline is a more informal program
which is maintained by T2S/MH/T3, etc, then it needs to be easy for us to
maintain. We already use `git` to maintain our code. The pipeline should adopt
this work-flow and be maintained as a _docs as code_ like repository.
