The **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** is one of the main protocols of the 
[Internet protocol suite](2021-06-15--06-19-15Z--internet_protocol_suite.md). It
originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the 
[Internet Protocol](2020-10-10--17-59-03Z--internet_protocol.md) (IP).
Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as _TCP/IP_. TCP provides
reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets (bytes)
between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network. 

TCP is [connection-oriented communication](2021-06-15--06-24-07Z--connection-oriented_communication.md), 
and a connection between client and server is established before data can be
sent.

Transmission Control Protocol
* Data comes from the [application layer](2020-10-11--18-04-48Z--application_layer.md) 
	and is packaged by TCP into *segments* which are then handed to the 
	[internet layer](2020-10-11--17-17-39Z--internet_layer.md).

## Protocol operation

### Connection establishment

_TCP 3-way handshake_

Before transmission sending and receiving devices must acknowledge each other's
presence and readiness to send and receive data.

1.  **SYN**: The active open is performed by the client sending a _SYN_ to the
		server. The client sets the segment's sequence number to a random value A.
2.  **SYN-ACK**: In response, the server replies with _SYN-ACK_. The
		acknowledgement number is set to one more than the received sequence number
		i.e. A+1, and the sequence number that the server chooses for the packet is
		another random number, B.
3.  **ACK**: Finally, the client sends an ACK back to the server. The sequence
		number is set to the received acknowledgment value i.e. A+1, and the
		acknowledgment number is set to one more than the received sequence number
		i.e. B+1.

_Note: Steps 1 & 2 establish and acknowledge the sequence number for one
direction. Steps 2 & 3 establish and acknowledge the sequence number for the
other direction. Following the completion of these steps, both the client and
server have received acknowledgements anda full-duplex communication is
established._

### Connection termination

Once transmission is complete -
Sending device: FIN
Receiving device: ACK, FIN
Sending device: ACK
