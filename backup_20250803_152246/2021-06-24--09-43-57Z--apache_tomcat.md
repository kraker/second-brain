## Install

### cPanel Install

```
yum install ea-tomcat85
```

Source: https://docs.cpanel.net/ea4/tomcat/tomcat/

Note, cPanel version of Apache Tomcat just doesn't really do everything you
would probably want it to, and 8.5 is pretty outdated by this point. 

### CentOS 7

#### Tomcat 8.*

* <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-apache-tomcat-8-on-centos-7>

#### Tomcat 9 through 10

Tomcat versions 9 through 10 work on CentOS 7 systems. Generally speaking we
should be installing the latest supported version unless the customer has a
preference or dependency reqs.
