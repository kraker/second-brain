## PVC

Coating. No significant fire protection

* **PVC:** polyvinyl chloride

## Plenum

*plenum-rated cable* creates much less smoke and fumes.

* 3x the cost of PVC coated
* For use in the *plenum* or space between acoustical tile and ceiling.

## Riser

For vertical runs between floors. Provide less protection than plenum.
Most installations today use plenum for runs between floors.
