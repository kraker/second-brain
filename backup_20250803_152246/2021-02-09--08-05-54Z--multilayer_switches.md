Switches typically work at [Layer 2](2020-10-10--18-43-20Z--layer_2.md) but as
shown in [InterVLAN Routing](2021-02-08--08-53-00Z--intervlan_routing.md)
switches can work at both Layer 2 and [Layer 3](2020-10-10--18-44-39Z--layer_3.md).
* A Layer 3 switch forwards traffic based on IP addresses. 
* Does what a traditional router does using software in hardware.
* To differentiate you can configure a port to be a _switchport_ or a _router_
	_port_.
