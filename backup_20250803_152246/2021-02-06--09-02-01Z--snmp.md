**Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)** is an 
[Internet Standard](2021-06-25--05-49-11Z--internet_standard.md) protocol for
collecting and organizing information about managed devices on 
[IP](2020-10-10--17-59-03Z--internet_protocol.md) networks and for modifying
that information to change device behavior. Devices that typically support SNMP
include cable modems, routers, switches, servers, workstations, printers, and
more.

Used for querying the state of SNMP-capable devices.

* Protocol: UDP
* Ports: 161, 162
* Gets useful stats like CPU, network utilization, and firewall hits.
* Uses _agents_ to collect network information from a 
	_Management Information Base (MIB)_ 
* Common tool used [www.cacti.net](https://www.cacti.net)
* SNMPv3 is today's standard and uses safe authentication and encryption

_The de facto network management protocol for TCP/IP networks._

## Managed Network

An SNMP system which creates a **managed network** consists of at least 3
components:
* SNMP manager
* Managed devices
* Management information bases
