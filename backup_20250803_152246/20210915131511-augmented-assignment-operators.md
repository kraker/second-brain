Instead of:

```python
>>> spam = 42
>>> spam = spam + 42
>>> spam
84
```

You can use shortcuts also known as **augmented assignment operators**.

```python
>>> spma = 42
>>> spma += 1
>>> spma
43
```

### Table of augmented assignment operators

| spam += 1                      | spam = spam + 1                 |
| spam -= 1                      | spam = spam -1                  |
| spam *= 1                      | spam = spam * 1                 |
| spam /= 1                      | spam = spam / 1                 |
