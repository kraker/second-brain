I think inspiration for how we should approach our pipeline should stem from
answering the following questions:

* Which subjects should you learn, and why?
* What is the best book or video lecture series for each subject?

This is in the same vein as [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)

### Bash Scripting

* [The Linux Command Line](https://www.linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php)
