Simplified TCP Segment
| Destination | Source | Sequence | Checksum | Flags | Acknowledgement | Data |
| port        | port   | number   |          |       |                 |      |

* Destination [port](20201011180028-port.md) tells OS where to send TCP Segment.
* Source [port](20201011180028-port.md) tells client/service what to do with returning info.
