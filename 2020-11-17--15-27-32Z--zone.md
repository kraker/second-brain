A zone is a container for a single domain that gets filled with records.

## Primary Zone
Are created on the DNS server that will act as the primary name server
for that zone.

## Secondary Zone
Are created on other DNS servers to act as backups to the primary zone.
* It's standard practice to have two, one as backup

## Reverse Lookup Zone
Enables a system to determine a [FQDN](2020-11-17--15-21-14Z--fqdn.md)
by knowing the IP address.
* [PTR](2020-11-17--15-28-31Z--dns_record.md)
