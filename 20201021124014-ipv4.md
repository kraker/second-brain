**Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)** is the fourth version of the 
[Internet Protocol](20201010175903-internet-protocol.md) (IP). It is one
of the core protocols of standards-based internetworking methods in the
[Internet](20201011171739-internet-layer.md) and other packet-switched
networks. IPv4 was the first version deplyed for production on SATNET in 1982
and on the ARPANET in January 1983. It is still used to route most Internet
traffic today, despite the ongoing deployment of a successor protocol, 
[IPv6](20201021124026-ipv6.md).

IPv4 uses a 32-bit address space which provides 4,294,967,296 (232) unique
addresses, but large blocks are reserved for special networking methods.

* Uses dotted-octet numbering system *(i.e. 192.168.0.1)*
  + 4 8-bit numbers 0-255, separated by '.', total of 32 bits.
  + 192.168.0.1 = 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001
