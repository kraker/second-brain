The **data link layer**, or **layer 2**, is the second layer of the seven-layer
[OSI model](20201006074200-osi-7-layer.md) of [computer networking](20210610054021-computer-network.md). 
This layer is the protocol layer that transfers data between nodes on a [network segment](20220217091103-network-segment.md)
across the [physical layer](20201010184100-layer-1.md).

* Delivers [frames](20201009144356-frame.md) between nodes on the same
  level of the network.
* Doesn't cross boundaries of [LAN](20201026125258-lan.md). 
  + Inter-network routing and global addressing are higher-layer functions.
