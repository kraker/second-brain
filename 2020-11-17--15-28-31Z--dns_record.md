A record is a line in the zone data that maps an [FQDN](2020-11-17--15-21-14Z--fqdn.md) to an IP address.
* Also known as *forward lookup* zone records.

## A
**A Record**
* Points the primary domain (FQDN) and any subdomains to a specific IP address.
* Often this includes the 'www' subdomain.

## SOA
**Start of Authority**
* Every forward lookup zone requires a SOA record that defines the primary name
	server in charge of the forward lookup zone.

## NS
**Name Server Record**
* Primary and usually secondary name servers for the domain.

## CNAME
**Canonical Name Record**
* Acts like an alias. Basically points one FQDN to another FQDN.

## AAAA
**AAAA Record**
* Equivalent of an 'A' record but reserved for IPv6 addresses.

## MX
**MX Record**
* Used exclusively by SMTP servers to determine where to send mail.

## SRV
**SRV Record**
* Supports any type of server
* Syntax:
	`_service.proto.name.  TTL  IN  SRV  priority  weight  port  target`
	+ *service* Name of the service supported by this record
	+ *proto* TCP or UDP
	+ *name* The domain name for this server (ends with a period)
	+ *TTL* Time to live in seconds
	+ *priority* The priority of the target host; used when multiple servers present.
	+ *weight* An arbitrary value to give certain services priority over others
	+ *port* The TCP or UDP port on which the service is found
	+ *target* The FQDN of the machine providing the service, ending in a dot
* Example:
	`_sip.tcp.testserve.com. 86400 IN SRV 0 5 5060 sipserver.mikemeyers.com.`

## TXT
**TXT Record**
* Freeform type of record that can be used for anything
* Often [SPF](2020-10-28--16-44-13Z--spf.md)/[DMARC](2020-10-28--17-02-36Z--dmarc.md)/[DKIM](2020-10-28--17-01-08Z--dkim.md) records are of this type
* Also, [DCV](2020-11-19--15-35-29Z--dcv.md) records can also be of this type

## PTR
**Pointer Record**
* Reverses the network ID and add a unique domain called "in-addr.arpa" to 
	create the zone. This points to a FQDN and allows for reverse lookups by 
	IP address.
