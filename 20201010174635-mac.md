# Media Access Control

Creates and addresses the frame.

## MAC Address

MAC-48 or EUI-48
* **[MAC](20201010174635-mac.md):** Media Access Control
* **EUI:** Extended Unique Identifier
	*Example: 00-40-05-60-7D-49*

* No two NICs share MAC addresses. Always have to be unique.
* Uses hexadecimal notation
* 48 bits total with 12 4 bit chars
	+ 48-bit binary address or 6-byte binary address
* IEEE issues MAC address to manufacturer, referred to as **OUI**
	+ **OUI:** Organizationally Unique Identifier
* NICs send a Layer 2 *broadcast* of FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF to request NICs MAC addresses.
	Every NIC on the network will process this.
* When the MAC address isn't known a NIC can use the IP address (Layer 3)
	to request the MAC address of the target NIC.

Run these in terminal to see MAC addresses:
Linux: `ip a` Windows: `ipconfig /all` MacOS: `ifconfig`
