Work at the bit level. For certain low-level tasks.

| Operator | Description                                                                |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `~`      | Bitwise negation. Negate all the bits in a number.                         |
| `<<`     | Left bitwise shift. Shift all bits in a number to the left.                |
| `>>`     | Right bitwise shift. Shift all bits in a number to the right.              |
| `&`      | Bitwise AND. Perform AND operation on all bits in two numbers.             |
| `|`      | Bitwise OR. Perform an OR operation on all bits in two numbers.            |
| `^`      | Bitwise XOR. Perform an exclusive OR operation on all bits in two numbers. |

Note that there are also corresponding assignment operators (for
example, `<<=`) for all but bitwise negation.

``` bash
# produce a list of powers of 2 using left bitwise shift operator
[me@linuxbox ~]$ for ((i=0;i<8;++i)); do echo $((1<<i)); done
1
2
4
8
16
32
64
128
```
