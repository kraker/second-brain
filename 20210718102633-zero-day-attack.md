The way an exploit takes advantage of a vulnerability is called an _attack
surface_. The timeframe in which a vulnerability can be exploited before patches
are applied is called the _attack window_. New attacks using vulnerabilities
that haven't yet been identified and patched are called _zero-day attacks_.
