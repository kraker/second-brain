# RHCE

Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE)

* [Ansible](20220311200359-ansible.md)
* [RHCSA](20231109085400-rhcsa.md): RHCE assumes proficiency in all of the RHCSA objectives. RHCSA is also a prerequisite.

## Learning resources

### Books

There aren't that many book resources that aren't out of date... current exam is on RHEL 9.

* [Red Hat RHCE 8 (EX294) Cert Guide - Sander van Vugt](https://www.sandervanvugt.com/red-hat-rhce-8-ex294-cert-guide/) - A bit outdated. Refers to Ansible Tower instead of AAP. Based on RHEL 8 but current exam is RHEL 9. But Sander van Vugt's courses and books are still considered the _defacto standard_ for preparing for both RHCSA and RHCE. His courses may be better, but I'm not 100% sold on how the content is structured in his books... it doesn't resonate as well with me compared to other written learning materials I've used.
* [Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE) Ansible Automation Study Guide \| Red Hat Developer](https://developers.redhat.com/e-books/ansible-study-guide) - Free with developer subscription. A good overview of the objectives, but it's breadth vs depth. Probably best as a supplementary study source. Seems like Red Hat is trying to sell you courses, AAP, etc. by giving away this ebook for free.
* [Ansible for DevOps - Ansible Book by Jeff Geerling](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com/) - Still one of the best sources out there on learning Ansible IMO. But not directed at RHCE specifically.

## To Study

**RHCE Ansible Automation Study Guide** - Alex Soto Bueno

- Chapter 6. Managing Files and Resources
    - [ ] assemble Module
    - [ ] fetch Module: basically the reverse of the copy Module.
- [ ] Chapter 7. Module Development
    - [ ] Ansible Doc command
    - [ ] Developing modules
- [ ] Chapter 9. Execution Environments
    - [ ] Building Execution Environments
    - [ ] Automation Content Navigator

## To Review

How do I list all of the modules ansible-doc can find?

```bash
ansible-doc -l
```

How do I initialize a new role with directory scaffolding?

```bash
# ??
```

How do I flush handlers in case I want to run them before all tasks have completed?

```yaml
meta ??
```

How do I trigger multiple handlers without needing to notify a list of them?

```yaml
handlers:
??
listen: "Name of handlers to trigger"
```

How do I list _all_ running processes with additional information?

```bash
ps -ef
```

### Package management

My system is already _subscribed_ how do I list all of the repositories available?

```bash
subscription-manager repos --list
```

It's an offline exam, so we shouldn't assume that we'll be able to use subscription manager. We may have to configure the repo's like we did for the RHCSA.

If you have the repository URL, how do you easily generate the repository client file?

```bash
dnf config-manager --add-repo=http://reposerver.example.com/BaseOS
```

For the exam, manually edit the file so that it includes the line gpgcheck=0 since that's not needed and setting it up is more complicated.

### template Module

Likely there won't be a way to access Jinja2 docs on the exam, need to review my syntax for building Jinja templates and installing them with the template module.
