# RHCE

Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE)

* [Ansible](20220311200359-ansible.md)
* [RHCSA](20231109085400-rhcsa.md): RHCE assumes proficiency in all of the RHCSA objectives. RHCSA is also a prerequisite.

## Learning resources

### Books

There aren't that many book resources that aren't out of date... current exam is on RHEL 9. Since RHEL 8 the exam is 90% Ansible-based. There seem to be a lot of study resources from prior to that, RHEL 7, etc. But that was a completely different exam.

* [Red Hat RHCE 8 (EX294) Cert Guide - Sander van Vugt](https://www.sandervanvugt.com/red-hat-rhce-8-ex294-cert-guide/) - A bit outdated. Refers to Ansible Tower instead of AAP. Based on RHEL 8 but current exam is RHEL 9. But Sander van Vugt's courses and books are still considered the _defacto standard_ for preparing for both RHCSA and RHCE. His courses may be better, but I'm not 100% sold on how the content is structured in his books... it doesn't resonate as well with me compared to other written learning materials I've used.
* [Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE) Ansible Automation Study Guide \| Red Hat Developer](https://developers.redhat.com/e-books/ansible-study-guide) - Free with developer subscription. A good overview of the objectives, but it's breadth vs depth. Probably best as a supplementary study source. Seems like Red Hat is trying to sell you courses, AAP, etc. by giving away this ebook for free.
* [Ansible for DevOps - Ansible Book by Jeff Geerling](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com/) - Still one of the best sources out there on learning Ansible IMO. But not directed at RHCE specifically.

How do I initialize a new role with directory scaffolding?

```bash
# ??
```

How do I flush handlers in case I want to run them before all tasks have completed?

meta ??
```

How do I trigger multiple handlers without needing to notify a list of them?

```yaml
handlers:
??
listen: "Name of handlers to trigger"
```

How do I list _all_ running processes with additional information?

```bash
ps -ef
```

What meta package do I need to install that provides access to commands like podman and other related utilities?

```

What 3 services do I need to allow in firewalld in order to allow NFS exports?

```bash

```

How do I mount and iso?

```bash
# It helps to let mount auto-detect fstype, opts, etc
[root@control ~]# mount /dev/sr0 /repo
mount: /repo: WARNING: source write-protected, mounted read-only.
# Then show them...
[root@control ~]# findmnt /repo
TARGET SOURCE   FSTYPE  OPTIONS
/repo  /dev/sr0 iso9660 ro,relatime,nojoliet,check=s,map=n,blocksize=2048
# add mount to /etc/fstab
[root@control ~]# grep iso /etc/fstab
/dev/sr0        /repo   iso9660 defaults        0 0
[root@control ~]# mount -va
/                        : ignored
/boot                    : already mounted
none                     : ignored
mount: /repo: WARNING: source write-protected, mounted read-only.
mount: (hint) your fstab has been modified, but systemd still uses
       the old version; use 'systemctl daemon-reload' to reload.
/repo                    : successfully mounted
```

How do I add a repo from a file (commonly from iso)?

```bash
[root@control ~]# ll /repo

How do I get a list of available services in firewalld?

```bash
firewall-cmd --get-services

### template Module

Likely there won't be a way to access Jinja2 docs on the exam, need to review my syntax for building Jinja templates and installing them with the template module.
