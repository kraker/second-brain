# RHCE

Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE)

* [Ansible](20220311200359-ansible.md)
* [RHCSA](20231109085400-rhcsa.md): RHCE assumes proficiency in all of the RHCSA objectives. RHCSA is also a prerequisite.

## Learning resources

### Books

There aren't that many book resources that aren't out of date... current exam is on RHEL 9. Since RHEL 8 the exam is 90% Ansible-based. There seem to be a lot of study resources from prior to that, RHEL 7, etc. But that was a completely different exam.

* [Red Hat RHCE 8 (EX294) Cert Guide - Sander van Vugt](https://www.sandervanvugt.com/red-hat-rhce-8-ex294-cert-guide/) - A bit outdated. Refers to Ansible Tower instead of AAP. Based on RHEL 8 but current exam is RHEL 9. But Sander van Vugt's courses and books are still considered the _defacto standard_ for preparing for both RHCSA and RHCE. His courses may be better, but I'm not 100% sold on how the content is structured in his books... it doesn't resonate as well with me compared to other written learning materials I've used.
* [Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE) Ansible Automation Study Guide \| Red Hat Developer](https://developers.redhat.com/e-books/ansible-study-guide) - Free with developer subscription. A good overview of the objectives, but it's breadth vs depth. Probably best as a supplementary study source. Seems like Red Hat is trying to sell you courses, AAP, etc. by giving away this ebook for free.
* [Ansible for DevOps - Ansible Book by Jeff Geerling](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com/) - Still one of the best sources out there on learning Ansible IMO. But not directed at RHCE specifically.

## To Review

How do I list all of the modules ansible-doc can find?

```bash
ansible-doc -l
```

How do I initialize a new role with directory scaffolding?

```bash
# ??
```

How do I flush handlers in case I want to run them before all tasks have completed?

```yaml
meta ??
```

How do I trigger multiple handlers without needing to notify a list of them?

```yaml
handlers:
??
listen: "Name of handlers to trigger"
```

How do I list _all_ running processes with additional information?

```bash
ps -ef
```

What meta package do I need to install that provides access to commands like podman and other related utilities?

```bash
dnf install container-tools
```

How do I search for roles or collections using commands available in ansible-core?

```bash
ansible-galaxy search NAME
```

How do I list available collections using an ansible execution environment?

```bash
ansible-navigator collections
```

### template Module

Likely there won't be a way to access Jinja2 docs on the exam, need to review my syntax for building Jinja templates and installing them with the template module.
