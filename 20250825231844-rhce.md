# RHCE

Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE)

* [Ansible](20220311200359-ansible.md)
* [RHCSA](20231109085400-rhcsa.md): RHCE assumes proficiency in all of the RHCSA objectives. RHCSA is also a prerequisite.

## Learning resources

### Books

There aren't that many book resources that aren't out of date... current exam is on RHEL 9.

* [Red Hat RHCE 8 (EX294) Cert Guide - Sander van Vugt](https://www.sandervanvugt.com/red-hat-rhce-8-ex294-cert-guide/) - A bit outdated. Refers to Ansible Tower instead of AAP. Based on RHEL 8 but current exam is RHEL 9. But Sander van Vugt's courses and books are still considered the _defacto standard_ for preparing for both RHCSA and RHCE. His courses may be better, but I'm not 100% sold on how the content is structured in his books... it doesn't resonate as well with me compared to other written learning materials I've used.
* [Red Hat Certified Engineer (RHCE) Ansible Automation Study Guide \| Red Hat Developer](https://developers.redhat.com/e-books/ansible-study-guide) - Free with developer subscription. A good overview of the objectives, but it's breadth vs depth. Probably best as a supplementary study source. Seems like Red Hat is trying to sell you courses, AAP, etc. by giving away this ebook for free.
* [Ansible for DevOps - Ansible Book by Jeff Geerling](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com/) - Still one of the best sources out there on learning Ansible IMO. But not directed at RHCE specifically.

## To Study

**RHCE Ansible Automation Study Guide** - Alex Soto Bueno

- Chapter 6. Managing Files and Resources
    - [ ] assemble Module
    - [ ] fetch Module: basically the reverse of the copy Module.
- [ ] Chapter 7. Module Development
    - [ ] Ansible Doc command
    - [ ] Developing modules
- [ ] Chapter 9. Execution Environments
    - [ ] Building Execution Environments
    - [ ] Automation Content Navigator

## To Review

How do I list all of the modules ansible-doc can find?

```bash
ansible-doc -l
```

How do I initialize a new role with directory scaffolding?

```bash
# ??
```

How do I flush handlers in case I want to run them before all tasks have completed?

```yaml
meta ??
```

How do I trigger multiple handlers without needing to notify a list of them?

```yaml
handlers:
??
listen: "Name of handlers to trigger"
```

How do I list _all_ running processes with additional information?

```bash
ps -ef
```

### Package management

My system is already _subscribed_ how do I list all of the repositories available?

```bash
subscription-manager repos --list
```

It's an offline exam, so we shouldn't assume that we'll be able to use subscription manager. We may have to configure the repo's like we did for the RHCSA.

If you have the repository URL, how do you easily generate the repository client file?

```bash
dnf config-manager --add-repo=http://reposerver.example.com/BaseOS
```

For the exam, manually edit the file so that it includes the line gpgcheck=0 since that's not needed and setting it up is more complicated.

### template Module

Likely there won't be a way to access Jinja2 docs on the exam, need to review my syntax for building Jinja templates and installing them with the template module.

### SELinux

How do I list all of the SELinux users?

```bash
seinfo -u
```

How do I show Linux and SELinux user mappings?

```bash
semanage login -l
```

How do I list SELinux contexts for ports?

```bash
semanage port -l
```

How do I list the SELinux context for all running processes?

```bash
ps -eZ
# or
ps -efZ
```

How do I list the SELinux context of a file?

```bash
ls -lZ /etc/password
```

What file do I need to edit to configure SELinux to either enforcing or permissive persistently?

```bash
vim /etc/selinux/config
```

What command do I need to run to show the current SELinux operating mode?

```bash
getenforce
# or
sestatus
```

What command do I use to temporarily change the context of a directory and it's contents recursively?

```bash
chcon -vu user_u -t public_content_t /tmp/sedir1 -R
```

What command do I use to permanently set the file context of a directory and it's contents recursively?

```bash
semanage fcontext -a -s user_u -t public_content_t '/tmp/sedir1(/.*)?'
```

How do I restore the file context of a directory and it's contents recursively?

```bash
restorecon -Rv /tmp/sedir1
```

How do I add port 8010 with type http_port_t and protocol tcp to the policy?

```bash
semanage port -at http_port_t -p tcp 8010
```

How do I copy a file and preserve it's SELinux context?

```bash
cp --preserve=context file .
```

How do I list all of the current selinux boolean settings?

```bash
getsebool -a
sestatus -b
semanage boolean -l
```

How do I persistently set a selinux boolean?

```bash
setsebool -P nfs_export_all_rw off
semanage boolean -m -0 nfs_export_all_rw
```

How do I analyze all of the AVC records in the audit.log file?

```bash
sealert -a /var/log/audit/audit.log
```

How do I search the audit.log for recent selinux denies?

```bash
ausearch -m avc -ts recent
```

What command do I need to run to ensure that SELinux is fully disabled in the kernel at boot?

```bash
grubby --update-kernal ALL --args selinux=0
```
