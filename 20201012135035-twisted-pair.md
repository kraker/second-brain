Commonly known as [Ethernet](20201012135112-ethernet.md).
Using a pair of twisted wires reduces a type of interference called *crosstalk*.

## Types

### Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)

Twisted pairs of wires surrounded by shielding to protect them from EMI.

| **Name** | **Description**                                                       |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| F/UTP    | Foil shields the entire cable; wires are UTP                          |
| S/UTP    | Braid screen shields entire cable; wires are UTP                      |
| SF/UTP   | Braid screen and foil shield the entire cable; wires are UTP          |
| S/FTP    | Braid screen shields entire cable; foil shields each twisted pair.    |
| F/FTP    | Foil screen shields the entire cable; foil shields each twisted pair. |
| U/FTP    | No overall shielding; each pair inside is shielded with foil.         |

### Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)

Twisted pairs of wires without shielding; surrounded by plastic jacket.
Only use in areas with low or no interference.

### Category (Cat) Ratings

| **Cat Rating** | **Max Frequency** | **Max Bandwidth** | **Status with TIA** |
|                |                   |                   | (+/-)               |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Cat 3          | 16 MHz            | 16 Mbps           | +                   |
| Cat 4          | 20 MHz            | 20 Mbps           | -                   |
| Cat 5          | 100 MHz           | 100 Mbps          | -                   |
| Cat 5e         | 100 MHz           | 1 Gbps            | +                   |
| Cat 6          | 250 MHz           | 10 Gbps           | +                   |
| Cat 6a         | 500 MHz           | 10 Gbps           | +                   |
| Cat 7          | 600 MHz           | 10+ Gbps          | -                   |
| Cat 7a         | 1000 MHz          | 40-100 Gbps       | -                   |
| Cat 8          | 2000 MHz          | 25-40 Gbps        | -                   |

* Cat 6 is Limited to 100 meters when using 10/100/1000BaseT networks. With
	10GBaseT networks Cat 6 is limited to 55 meters.
* Cat 6a cables can use the full 100-meter length with networks up to 10GBaseT.
* Cat 7a cables can theoretically support 40 Gbps at 50 meters; 100 Gbps at 15
	meters.

## Connectors

Telephones used RJ-11.
Current wired networks use *four-pair 8 position 8 contact (8P8C)*, but in
practice these are called [RJ-45](20201014131806-rj-45.md) because
that's what they look like.
