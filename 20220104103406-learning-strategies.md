# Learning Strategies

### Take Smart Notes

Taking notes effectively is what I like to call a _force multiplier._ Over the
long-run having an effective note taking methodology can pay back dividends
multiple times over. After quite a bit of experimentation I've discovered a
variation of the _Zettelkasten_ note-taking system works best for my needs. When
your body of notes becomes hundreds of pages or 1,000's it's important to have a
system to search, make connections between concepts and ideas, and organize your
notes.

  + [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/)
  + I use my own methodology that uses the vim editor plus some helper plugins
  along with my own custom functions. 

#### Learn Markdown (Optional)

After some experimentation with other text markups I've settled on using
Markdown to write my notes. The syntax is intuitive and easily understood in
plain-text. It also is designed to be easily rendered into HTML. This makes
self-hosting my notes fairly straightforward. (This page is written in Markdown
and self-hosted on my notes website)

Hand-written notes are preferred for memory retention and for some it's easier
to hand-write notes. But having a searchable notes database, and the ability to
easily make links between notes, using a computerized system is preferred.
Markdown is a widely supported syntax for authoring text-based notes. It's
relatively future proof in that there's likely to be parsers and renderers available for it
for quite some time.

* Official Spec: [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

A note-taking system that uses a collection of simple text files (i.e. Markdown
files) is future proof in that you control your data. It's not tied to some
proprietary platform that may not still exist in 15-20 years. Roam Research (see
link above) is an example of this kind of _vendor lock-in._
