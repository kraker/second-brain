`while commands; do commands; done`

Like _if_ while evaluates the exit status of a list of commands while continues
until either a `break` or the commands evaluate to false

Example:

``` bash
#!/bin/bash
# while-count: display a series of numbers

count=1
while [[ "$count" -le 5 ]]; do
    echo "$count"
    count=$((count + 1))
done
echo "Finished."
```
