A **network switch** (also called **switching hub**, **bridging hub**, and, by
the [IEEE](2020-10-13--13-12-35Z--networking_industry_standards_ieee.md), **MAC bridge**)
is [networking hardware](2021-06-18--06-10-59Z--networking_hardware.md) that
connects devices on a [computer network](2021-06-10--05-40-21Z--computer_network.md) 
by using [packet switch](2021-06-18--06-13-12Z--packet_switching.md) to
receive and forward data to the destination device.

A network switch is a multiport [network bridge](2021-06-18--06-15-12Z--network_bridge.md)
that uses [MAC addresses](2020-10-09--14-32-55Z--mac.md) to forward data at the 
[data link layer](2020-10-10--18-43-20Z--layer_2.md) (layer 2) of the   
[OSI Model](20201006074200-osi_7_layer.md). Some switches can also forward data
at the [network layer](2020-10-10--18-44-39Z--layer_3.md) (layer 3) by
additionally incorporating [routing](2020-11-05--13-08-48Z--routing.md)
functionality. Such switches are commonly known as layer-3 switches or 
[multilayer switches](2021-02-09--08-05-54Z--multilayer_switches.md).

Switches for [Ethernet](2020-10-12--13-51-12Z--ethernet.md) are the most common
form of network switch.

* Take advantage of [MAC addresses](2020-10-09--14-32-55Z--mac.md) to allow
	devices to communicate directly.
* At first a switch acts like a hub, forwarding all
	[frames](2020-10-09--14-43-56Z--frame.md) to all devices, but quickly creates
	a [source address table](2020-10-16--14-04-40Z--source_address_table.md) (SAT)
	and only forwards to destination MAC addresses.
* Each device connection can run at full network speed.
* [Unicast](2020-10-09--14-43-56Z--frame.md) messages always go only to the intended recipient.
* All broadcast messages go to all ports except origin port.

Switches can cannect to each other with these.

## Troubleshooting

### Obvious Physical Damage

1. Examine switch for physical damage.
   + Replace any obviously damaged switches.

### Dead Ports

1. look to see if port is flashing
2. If not, try a different port.
3. Try replacing or testing cable.
