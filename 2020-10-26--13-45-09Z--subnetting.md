**Subnetting** is the process of designating some high-order bits from the host
part as part of the network prefix and adjusting the subnet mask appropriately.
This divides a network into smaller subnets. The following diagram modifies the
[subnet mask](2020-10-26--13-10-55Z--subnet_mask.md) example by moving 2 bits
from the host part to the network prefix to form four smaller subnets each one
quarter of the previous size. 

|                | **Binary form**                       | **Dot-decimal** |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------|
| IP address     | `11000000.00000000.00000010.10000010` | 192.0.2.130     |
| Subnet mask    | `11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000` | 255.255.255.192 |
| Network prefix | `11000000.00000000.00000010.10000000` | 192.0.2.128     |
| Host part      | `00000000.00000000.00000000.00000010` | 0.0.0.2         |

* Enables a much more efficient use of IP addresses compared to 
	[class blocks](2020-10-26--13-26-44Z--class_ids.md).
* Don't think about in terms of _network IDs_ and _subnet masks_ but as binary
	numbers 

## Calculating hosts

2^x - 2 = number of hosts possible on a given subnet

Where x is the number of binary digits you have remaining _after_ the subnet
mask. In the following example we extend from `/24` to `/26` creating 4 subnets.
That leaves 6 bits remaining for each subnet. That gives us 2^6 = 64 and 
64 - 2 = 62.

## Making a Subnet

1. Start with a single _network ID_. In this example we'll convert
	 `192.168.4.0/24` into 4 subnets.
2. Convert _network ID_ from step 1 to binary:
	 `11000000.10101000.00000100.00000000`
3. How many subnets are you trying to create? In this example we're trying to
	 create 4 unique subnets.
	 + The formula for determining how many subnets you create is 2^y.
4. Using this formula 2^2 = 4 and therefore we need to extend the subnet down to
   `/26` because y=2. 
   _Note: you extend the subnet down by 'y' binary digits to create the number of subnets 2^y._ 
5. Extend the _network ID_ by _y_ digits and write out all possible subnets in
	 binary. 
	 + 4 new _network IDs_ with `/26` as a subnet mask:
	 ```
	 11000000.10101000.00000100.00000000
	 11000000.10101000.00000100.01000000
	 11000000.10101000.00000100.10000000
	 11000000.10101000.00000100.11000000
	 ```
	 _Note: the extension of the network IDs to the 26th bit._
6. Convert _network IDs_ back to dotted decimal
	 | **Network ID**   | **Host Range**                | **Broadcast Address** |
	 |------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|
	 | 192.168.4.0/26   | 192.168.4.1 - 192.168.4.62    | 192.168.4.63          |
	 | 192.168.4.64/26  | 192.168.4.65 - 192.168.4.126  | 192.168.4.127         |
	 | 192.168.4.128/26 | 192.168.4.129 - 192.168.4.190 | 192.168.4.191         |
	 | 192.168.4.192/26 | 192.168.4.193 - 192.168.4.254 | 192.168.4.255         |
	 _Note: The first and last address in the subnet are always reserved for the
	 network ID and broadcast address._
