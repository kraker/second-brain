Match first set of octets in network ID. In other words, tells devices on the
network, how many groupings in the IP address to compare, before determining if
an IP is local or not.

* An IPv4 subnet mask consists of 32 bits: 
	+ It is a sequence of ones (1) followed by a block of zeros (0). 
	+ The ones indicate bits in the address used for the network prefix and the
		trailing block of zeros designates that part as being the host identifier.

The following example shows the _network prefix_ and _host ID_ for
`192.168.5.23` and it's associated `/24` subnet mask `255.255.255.0`.

|                    | **Dotted Decimal** | **Binary**                          |
|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| IP address         | 192.168.5.23       | 11000000.10101000.00000101.00010111 |
| Subnet mask        | 255.255.255.0      | 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 |
| Network ID         | 192.168.5.0        | 11000000.10101000.00000101.x        |
| (_network prefix_) |                    |                                     |
| Host ID            | x.x.x.23           | x.x.x.00010111                      |
| (_rest field_)     |                    |                                     |

The result of the [bitwise AND](2021-06-27--11-25-37Z--bitwise_operation.md)
operation of IP address and the subnet mask is the network prefix `192.0.2.0`.
The host part which is `130`, is derived by the bitwise AND operation of the
address and the [one's complement](2021-06-27--11-50-02Z--one's_complement.md)
of the subnet mask.

* By definition all devices on the same network have the same subnet mask and
	[network ID](2020-10-26--12-51-17Z--network_id.md)

## Shorthand

[IP address](2020-10-10--18-03-22Z--ip_address.md) followed by / and number of
1s in the subnet mask.

* 201.23.45.123/24 has subnet mask 255.255.255.0

## [Class IDs](2020-10-26--13-26-44Z--class_ids.md)

## Calculating hosts

2^x - 2 = number of hosts. Where x is number of digits after subnet mask.
