-   Every [TCP/IP](20201006074410-tcp_ip_model.md) [LAN](2020-10-26--12-52-58Z--lan.md) that wants to connect to another TCP/IP LAN must have a [router](2020-10-10--18-08-51Z--router.md) connection.
-   A router must have an IP address on every LAN that it interconnects.
-   Also known as the *[default gateway](2020-10-26--13-03-07Z--default_gateway.md).*
-   No two LANs on the same [WAN](2020-10-17--17-08-19Z--wan.md) can share the same [network ID](2020-10-26--12-51-17Z--network_id.md).
