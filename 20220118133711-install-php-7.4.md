Some of the libraries that ship with cPanel's PHP 7.4 aren't as up-to-date as we
would like and in rare cases dependency issues are encountered. 

One example is meeting the pdo_sqlite library dependency for _sellacious_.
See dependency req's: https://www.sellacious.com/documentation-v2#/learn/basics/system-requirements

(The version of pdo_sqlite that currently ships with `ea-php74` is _3.7.17_)

In this case we have a few options. The most up-to-date rpm's available are from
the _remi repo_: http://mirror.bebout.net/remi/enterprise/7/php74/x86_64/repoview/php.html

## PHP 7.4 from remi repo

We can provision the remi repo with:

```bash
yum install http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-7.rpm
```

In this particular case we probably also need to enable the `remi-php74` repo
with:

```bash
yum-config-manager --enable remi-php74
```

But if we try to install any of the php74 packages from that repo on a cPanel
server we'll encounter _no package available_ errors. This is because cPanel
excludes php packages in the `/etc/yum.conf`. We need to remove `php*` from the
following string int the `/ect/yum.conf` file:

```
exclude=bind-chroot courier* dovecot* exim* filesystem httpd* mod_ssl* mydns* mysql* nsd* perl* php* proftpd* pure-ftpd* ruby* spamassassin* squirrelmail*
```

_At this point, we're as far as I've made it in provisioning an alternative PHP
7.4 rpm. I haven't had a chance to test this on a test VPS yet._
