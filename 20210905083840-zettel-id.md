Zettels should be unique across the Zettelkasten.  Since it's difficult to
always know if you're repeating yourself when you create a file-name, it's
probably best practice to use a unique string as the ID.
[neuron](https://neuron.zettel.page/id.html) solves this by making the string a
random 8 char string. Org-roam uses date + time down the second and prefixed to
the file-name.  I like this method because it's still unique with the string of
date/time numbers but also still has the title of the file in the ID.  It makes
fuzzy finding files a bit easier. Otherwise you need to grep through the files
somehow.
