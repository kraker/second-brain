The code in the **while** [clause](20210911075037-clause.md) will be executed as
long as it's [condition](20210911072918-conditions.md) is _True_.

_while_ statements always consist of:

* The _while_ keyword
* A condition
* A colon
* Starting on a newline, an indented _clause_

AKA the _while loop_.

## Example

```python
while spam < 5;
    print('Hello, world.')
    spam = spam + 1
```
