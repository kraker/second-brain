## Install Varnish 6.5

Just install the script and then install with yum per their docs: 

<https://packagecloud.io/varnishcache/varnish65/packages/el/7/varnish-6.5.2-0.0.el7.x86_64.rpm>

```bash
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/varnishcache/varnish65/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash
```

```bash
sudo yum install varnish-6.5.2-0.0.el7.x86_64
```

I would imagine process is basically the same for other versions of Varnish.
