**Carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD)** is a 
[Media Access Control](2020-10-10--17-46-35Z--mac.md) (MAC) method used most
notably in early [Ethernet](2020-10-12--13-51-12Z--ethernet.md) technology for 
[local area networking](2020-10-26--12-52-58Z--lan.md). It uses carrier-sensing
to defer transmission until no other stations are transmitting. This is used in
combination with collision detection in which a transmitting station detects
collisions by sensing transmissions from other stations while it is transmitting
a [Frame](2020-10-09--14-43-56Z--frame.md). When this collision condition is
detected, the station stops transmitting that frame, transmits a jam signal, and
then waits for a random time interval before trying to resend the frame.

* **CSMA/CD:** carrier sense multiple access/collision detection
* Used to determine which NIC should use a shared cable at a given moment
* NICs listen and if the line is free can send a frame
* Equal access
* If a collision occurs NICs will calculate a random interval and attempt to resend.
