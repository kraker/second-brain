We provide links to the official MySQL docs on MyISAM and InnoDB, but I actually
feel like the cPanel University course does a pretty good job of introducing
the differences between these two database engines. 

## Resources

Why not link to our wiki troubleshoot guide for innodb force recovery
troubleshooting?

The link for MySQLcheck links to the CloudLinux cagefs page, which seems broken.

I do actually like the link to the official docs on the `mysqladmin` but why not
introduce this the sysadmin way with `man mysqladmin`? 

Speaking of which, we should probably introduce `man` `info` and `apropos`
commands as part of the pipeline.

## Repairing databases

Might just be my machine, but I'm not getting any sound for this video.

I do like covering database repair as part of the pipeline though. 

But I feel like teaching the CLI way to import/export databases is probably a
precursor to teaching database repair. 

`mysqldump` and `mysql` commands come before `mysqlcheck` in my opinion.
