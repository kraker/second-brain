## Tests

### Wiremap

The wiremap test is used to identify physical installation errors; improper pin
termination, shorts between any two or more wires,
[continuity](20210624062522-continuity-test.md) to the remote end,
[split pairs](20210624061742-split-pairs.md), crossed pairs, reversed
pairs, and any other mis-wiring. 

### Cable Length

The Cable Length test verifies that the 
[copper cable](20210624063807-copper-conductor.md) from the transmitter
to receiver does not exceed the maximum recommended distance of 100 meters in a
10BASE-T/100BASE-TX/1000BASE-T network.
