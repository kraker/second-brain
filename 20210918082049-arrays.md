Regular variables are known in computer science as *scalars*. Arrays are
organized like a table. A spreadsheet acts like a *two-dimensional*
array. An individual array element is accessed using an address called
an *index* or *subscript*. Most programming languages support
multi-dimensional arrays. In Bash arrays are limited to a single
dimension.
