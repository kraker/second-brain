Some applications query the network using this protocol; `ping` for example.

## Wikipedia

The **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)** is a supporting protocol in the
internet protocol suite. Is is used by network devices, including
[routers](20201010180851-router.md), to send error messages and
operational information indicating success or failure when communicating with
another IP address, for example, an error is indicated when a requested service
is not available or that a host or router could not be reached. ICMP differes
from transport protocols such as [TCP](20201010181222-tcp.md) and
[UDP](20201011173654-udp.md) in that it is not typically used to
exchange data between systems, nor is it regularly employed by end-user network
applications (with the exception of some diagnostic tools like [ping](20210614064411-ping.md) and
[traceroute](20210614064532-traceroute.md)).
