# /home

If you landed here, my name is Alex Kraker, and this is my "second brain" also known
as my [zettelkasten](20210209083017-zettelkasten.md), or sometimes referred to as
a _digital garden_. This is a collection of my notes, thoughts, ideas, and research on
various things.

## point-of-entry

The best entry point is probably the \[search\] button at the top; I've long ago given up on a more structured approach to organizing my notes. I work in IT so most of my notes are on those topics. Search terms along the lines of "bash", "python", "linux", "networking", "rhel", "ansible", etc. tend to yield results. Pick a topic and see where it takes you.

I also have a somewhat neglected [/index](old-index.md) page if you'd like to start there.

If you're curious about the keeper of this digital garden, see [alexkraker.com](https://alexkraker.com) for my more "official" web presence.

## sauce

All of my notes are open-source, and maintained as markdown files in my
[second-brain](https://github.com/kraker/second-brain) repository on my GitHub.
This site is hosted for free by GitHub Pages. If you're interested in that sort of thing,
see my [notes](https://github.com/kraker/notes) repository for the source.

## note taking

These days I mostly use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to take notes. I use a Git plugin that automatically backs up my notes to GitHub at regular intervals.

If this topic interests you, I did a write up of my [note-taking methodology](https://alexkraker.com/posts/second-brain/) on my blog.
