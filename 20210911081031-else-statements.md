An _if_ [clause](20210911075037-clause.md) can optionally be followed by an
**else Statement**. The else clause is executed only when the [if
statement's](20210911074717-if-statements.md)
[condition](20210911072918-conditions.md) is _False_.

_else_ statement always consists of the following:

* The _else_ keyword
* A colon
* Starting on the next line, and indented block of code

```python
if name == 'Alice':
    print('Hi, Alice.')
else:
    print('Hello, stranger.')
```
