## Database Files

`.idb` - Stores table data and indexes
`ibdata1` and `ib_logfile0/1` - Stored at root of data dir, contains system
info, table metadata, data dictionary info, and various other InnoDB-specific
components

## Troubleshooting

Deleting `ibdata1` is almost never a good idea. Only do this as a last resort.
If you have InnoDB tables, this will effectively _wipe the slate clean_ and
you'll no longer be able to access your data.
