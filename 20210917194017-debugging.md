If testing reveals a problem the next step is debugging.

1.  Isolate

    Isolate the problem area by commenting out sections of code

    ``` bash
    if [[ -d $dir_name ]]; then
        if cd $dir_name; then
            rm *
        else
            echo "cannot cd to '$dir_name'" >&2
            exit 1
        fi
    # else
    #    echo "no such directory: '$dir_name'" >&2
    #    exit 1
    fi
    ```

2.  Tracing

    Tracing by placing informative messages in the script

    ``` bash
    echo "preparing to delete files" >&2
    if [[ -d $dir_name ]]; then
        if cd $dir_name; then
    echo "deleting files" >&2
            rm *
        else
            echo "cannot cd to '$dir_name'" >&2
            exit 1
        fi
    else
        echo "no such directory: '$dir_name'" >&2
        exit 1
    fi
    echo "file deletion complete" >&2
    ```

    *Send messages to standard error to separate them from normal
    output.* *Don't indent so easier to find when time to remove.*

    Implement tracing by the **-x** options and the set command with the
    **-x** option.

    ``` bash
    #!/bin/bash -x
    # trouble: script to demonstrate common errors
    number=1
    if [ $number = 1 ]; then
        echo "Number is equal to 1."
    else
        echo "Number is not equal to 1."
    fi
    ```

    <div>

    <span class="label">example</span>

    ``` bash
    [me@linuxbox ~]$ trouble
    + number=1
    + '[' 1 = 1 ']'
    + echo 'Number is equal to 1.'
    Number is equal to 1.
    ```

    </div>

    *The **+** is the default char for trace output,* *contained in the
    **PS4** shell variable.*

      - You can change the **PS4** variable to print line numbers

        ``` bash
        [me@linuxbox ~]$ export PS4='$LINENO + '
        [me@linuxbox ~]$ trouble
        5 + number=1
        7 + '[' 1 = 1 ']'
        8 + echo 'Number is equal to 1.'
        Number is equal to 1.
        ```

    <!-- end list -->

      - To trace a section of the script, use `set -x` `set +x`

        ``` bash
        #!/bin/bash

        # trouble: script to demonstrate common errors
        number=1

        set -x # Turn on tracing
        if [ $number = 1 ]; then
            echo "Number is equal to 1."
        else
            echo "Number is not equal to 1."
        fi
        set +x # Turn off tracing
        ```

3.  Examine values during execution

    Echo variables to see internal workings during execution

    ``` bash
    echo "number=$number" # DEBUG
    set -x # Turn on tracing
    if [ $number = 1 ]; then
        echo "Number is equal to 1."
    else
        echo "Number is not equal to 1."
    fi
    set +x # Turn off tracing
    ```
