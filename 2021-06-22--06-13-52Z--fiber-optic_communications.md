**Fiber-optic communication** is a method of transmitting information from one
place to another by sending pulses of infrared light through an 
[Optical fiber](2021-06-18--07-49-11Z--optical_fiber.md). The light is a form of
[carrier wave](2021-06-22--06-15-59Z--carrier_wave.md) that is 
[modulated](2021-06-22--06-16-54Z--modulated.md) to carry information. Fiber is
preferrred over electrical cabling when high [bandwidth](2021-06-22--06-23-29Z--bandwidths.md), 
long distance, or immunity to [electromagnetic interference](2020-10-12--13-31-39Z--emi.md) is required.
