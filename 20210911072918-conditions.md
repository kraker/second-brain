**Conditions** (aka expressions) evaluate to a [boolean
value](20210910210804-boolean-values.md) of _True_ or _False_.

In the context of flow control statements expressions are called _conditions_. A
flow control statement decides what to do based on whether its condition is
_True_ or _False_.

Conditions are always followed by a block of code called a [clause](20210911075037-clause.md).
