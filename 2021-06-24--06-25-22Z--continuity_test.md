In [electronics](2021-06-24--06-26-00Z--electronics.md), a **continuity test**
is the checking of an [electric circuit](2021-06-24--06-26-53Z--electric_circuit.md)
to see if [electric current](2021-06-24--06-28-28Z--electric_current.md) flows
(that it is in fact a complete circuit).

* Performed by placing small voltage (LED or noise-producing component) across
	the chosen path.
* If electron flow is inhibited by:
	+ broken conductors
	+ damaged components
	+ excessive [resistance](2021-06-24--06-31-49Z--electrical_resistance_and_conductance.md)
	... the circuit is "open".
* Can use:
	+ multimeters
	+ continuity testers
	+ Or simply light bulb, LED, or piezoelectric speaker
