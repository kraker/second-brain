In computer networking, the **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)** is one of the core
members of the [Internet protocol suite](2021-06-15--06-19-15Z--internet_protocol_suite.md). With UDP, computer applications can send
messages, in this case referred to as _datagrams_, to other hosts on an
[Internet Protocol](2020-10-10--17-59-03Z--internet_protocol.md) (IP) network.
Prior communications are not required in order to set up communication channels
or paths. 

UDP uses a simple [connectionless communication](2021-06-15--06-12-27Z--connectionless_communication.md) 
model with a minimum of protocol mechanisms.

**UDP datagram**
| Destination | Source | Length | Checksum | Data |
| port        | port   |        |          |      |

_Lacks most of extra fields found in [TCP segments](2020-10-11--17-47-27Z--tcp_segment.md), 
since it's [connectionless](2020-10-11--17-33-45Z--connection_vs_connectionless.md)._

* Best for transmitting lots of data where dropped frames won't make much difference
* Really fast compared to [TCP](2020-10-10--18-12-22Z--tcp.md).
* [DNS](2020-10-21--13-18-18Z--dns.md) and
	[DHCP](2020-10-21--13-18-28Z--dhcp.md) are two examples that use UDP
