In [fiber-optic communication](2021-06-22--06-13-52Z--fiber-optic_communications.md),
a **single-mode optical fiber (SMF)** is an [optical fiber](2021-06-18--07-49-11Z--optical_fiber.md)
designed to carry only a single [mode](2021-06-23--06-06-47Z--mode.md) of
light - the [transverse mode](2021-06-23--06-07-37Z--transverse_mode.md). Modes
are the possible solutions of the Helmholtz equation for waves, which is
obtained by combining Maxwell's equations and the boundary conditions. These
modes define the way the wave travels through space, i.e. how the wave is
distributed in space. Waves can have the same mode but have different
frequencies. This is the case in single-mode fibers, where we can have waves
with different frequencies, but of the same mode, which means that they are
distributed in space the same way, and that gives us a single ray of light.
Although the ray travels parallel to the length of the fiber, it is often called 
[Transverse mode](2021-06-23--06-07-37Z--transverse_mode.md) since its
[electromagnetic](2021-06-23--06-14-29Z--electromagnetic.md) oscillations occur
perpendicular (transverse) to the length of the fiber.
