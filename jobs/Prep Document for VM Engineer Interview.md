**ðŸ”¹ Vulnerability Management:**

1. Can you explain the **vulnerability management lifecycle**?

* Discovery & identification
  + vuln scans
  + compliance audits
  + pentests
* Assessment & prioritization
  + CVSS scoring
  + Analyze threat vectors
  + Business impact
* Planning & coordination
  + patch
  + workaround
  + accept risk
  + technical controls
* Remediation
  + patch
  + configuration
  + compensating controls
  + reduce surface area if not needed
* Verification
  + re-scan, oscap scan
  + pentest
* Monitoring & reporting
  + ongoing tracking, usually a tool like tenable nessus
  + file integrity monitoring, config drift
  + ongoing scanning to compliance baseline

1. How do you **prioritize vulnerabilities** after a scan?

* Severity, usually CVSS score or in the case of compliance auditing could be CAT I, II, or III
* SLA's:
  + Critical 1-2 weeks
  + High 30 days
  + Medium 90 days
  + Low next maintenance window, maybe not at all depending on analysis
* Analyze threat vectors, is the vuln actually exploitable in our environment?
* Potential business impact? Is business critical infra vulnerable?
* Effort to remediate vs. some other kind of mitigating control
  + balance between potential impact and what's practical

1. How do you **group or categorize vulnerabilities** for remediation?
  + by severity or overall score after analyze with matrix

1. What do you typically do with **scan results**?
  + If results aren't already aggregated in some type of dashboard, they may be exported and imported into something else
  + Export to something like a CSV and run through a custom script or parser
  + If it's part of a piece of devops automation it may be something that's fetched and stored as an artifact in the ci/cd tool

1. How do you verify the **accuracy of findings** across OS, databases, and containers?
  + OS compare to vendor CVE database. Sometimes package version may have security backports but the scanner doesn't pick up on it.
  + Cross reference with database engine documentation, published vulns, etc.
  + Independently corroborate findings with another scanning tool like openscap
  + 
1. What vulnerability **scanning tools** have you used?
  + Tenable Nessus
  + OpenSCAP CLI or Workbench
1. How would you manage vulnerabilities using a **ticketing system** (e.g., ServiceNow)?
  + Jira kanban board, organized by severity
  + Further organized by OS, application, database, infra
  + Or perhaps organized by team
  + Possibly organized by environment (i.e. sandbox, dev, qa/test, prod)
  + organized by stage in the vuln management process
    - discovery -> assessment -> planning -> remediation -> verification -> monitoring

1. How would you **automate vulnerability tracking and remediation**?
  + Use an overall vuln management tool like tenable cloud maybe
  + Integrate with ticket management system
  + Could leverage API's and write scripts, pipelines, or other thigns to "glue" together a solution based on needs or as things evolve

ðŸ”¹ Operating System & Infrastructure Security

1. How do you approach **hardening an operating system** and scaling it across environments?
    + Starts with building a secure hardened image that's configured to a baseline, possibly a compliance baseline
    + Ideally the same automation that's used to harden the image is modular and can be used to maintain the config baselin ongoing on subsequent deployed infra
    + Patch automation
    + automate deployment of observabilit tools, noc/soc tooling, etc
    + "onboarding" automation built into deployment pipelines for new infra; modular approach so that can also remediate existing infra
    + scalling implies sandbox, dev, maybe qa/test, prod environments. rolling release that moves up the environments ending at prod
2. What are some common **Linux misconfigurations** youâ€™ve seen, and how did you fix them?
  + Wide-open sudoers. Develop an aproach around rbac and polp. groups should be limited to only what they need only on the hosts or environments where needed
  + shared ssh keys, deploy key rotation, idm solution to manage federated users centrally, ephemeral keys like teleport
  + services run as root, create user/group and privileges necessary, reconfigure service to run as a user/group
  + Wide-open file access privileges 777 or 666, add users to a group give that group the access it needs. script something to fix file and directory privs. sgid and sticky bits for shared directories. use config as code and define "state" of infra and impose it over whole infra. impose limits using fs mount opts with nfs or cifs mounts. can also monitor file-integrity using observability tools.
1. Are you familiar with **SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID)**? Why are they security concerns?
  + Yes executables with suid will run as the user that owns the file, useful for things like passwd cmd. sgid typically used to set directory privs so that files created in directory are owned by that group and any user that's part of that group can read/write. sticky bit if don't want users to delete files owned by other users.
1. How do you ensure **OS resilience** against vulnerabilities?
  + Regular patching
  + continued monitoring
  + regular scanning
  + config to consistent security hardened baselined, sshd, selinux, fapolicyd, firewalld, etc ongoing improvements as time/effort allows or depending on overall assesment of vulns and security posture

ðŸ”¹ **Kubernetes & Container Security**

1. Can you walk me through the **Kubernetes architecture**?
 + control plane and worker nodes
 + networking and dns layer
 + services, attached volumes, exposed ports
1. What are the key steps for **hardening Kubernetes clusters** in deployment?
  + good devops practices like using a secrets store
1. How do you secure **container images** and manage vulnerabilities in them?
  + container security scanning tools. build images secured to a compliance baseline just like linux os
  + podman run containers rootless vs as root
  + selinux contexts run in
  + limit privileges to mounted volumes
  + nat traffic, only expose ports necessary
1. What tools or methods do you use for **container security scanning**?
  + haven't used any
1. How would you assess and improve the **security posture of a Kubernetes environment**?
  + isolate namespaces
  + separation of concerns, run different workloads in different clusters
  + limit privileges of admins who have access to control plane
1. **Scenario:** How do you manage **separate Kubernetes environments (dev, staging, prod)** across multiple clouds (AWS, Azure, etc.) to ensure consistent security and configuration?
  + might reach for a tool like suse rancher or terraform for consistent maintainable environments
  + helm deployments
1. **Scenario:** What specific security controls would you implement in a **Kubernetes staging environment** to enforce the principle of least privilege and prevent a breach from spreading to production?

ðŸ”¹ **Cloud & Multi-Cloud Security:**

1. How do you approach **multi-cloud vulnerability management**?
  + IaC, consistent network topology, acl's, sg's
  + secure images and containers to same baseline
  + could use single-pane of glass idm solution like cyberark or teleport
  + time-boxed users sessions when accessing prod environments
  + separate accounts for prod vs non-prod
  + cloud security scanning
  + data encrypted at rest
  + use dmz + private lan on different subnets. firewall appliance or use cloud firewall services. vpn access to private lan. use load balancers, waf's, reverse proxy, outgoing proxy. publicly accessible endpoints behind something like cloudflare for ddos.
1. What are the challenges of **multi-cloud architecture security**, and how have you addressed them?
    1. access is one
    2. networking, separate network account
    3. inconsistent network topology, firewall rules, could us sd-wan and fw appliances like meraki or fortinet and manage config centrally, use config as code to try to keep consistent desired "state" across infra.
2. Describe your experience with **AWS and Azure** in managing vulnerabilities. How would you extend that to other clouds?
    1. Things like acls and sg's/nsgs very similar. I think it starts with secure and best-practice network topology. Can model same topology in multi-cloud environment.
    2. iac again
    3. centralized secrets store
    4. rbac and polp applies across multi-cloud
    5. 
3. How do you manage vulnerabilities across different **infrastructure layers** (OS, containers, cloud services)?
4. What is your approach to **cloud security posture management (CSPM)**?

ðŸ”¹ **Compliance & Standards**

1. What is your understanding of **PCI DSS** in the context of vulnerability management?
  + pci dss scanning, tls versions, kex algos,
1. How do compliance requirements influence your **remediation priorities**?
  + severity
  + impact and effort to remediate
  + protect card-holder data
  + threat vectors

ðŸ”¹ **CI/CD & Automation**

1. How have you integrated **vulnerability scanning and management into CI/CD pipelines**?
2. What automation tools or scripts have you built to support vulnerability management?
3. **Scenario:** Explain how you integrate **container image scanning into your CI/CD pipeline**. Whatâ€™s your process for promoting a securely scanned image from staging to production?

ðŸ”¹ **Behavioral & Communication**

1. Walk me through your **day-to-day responsibilities** in your current or previous role.
2. How do you communicate **vulnerability risks to non-technical stakeholders**?
  + try to keep it high level
  + communicate potential impact, severity, and effort to remediate including timelines
  + track key deliverables
  + organize into epics, stories and projects, agile
1. Can you give an example of a time when you had to **handle a critical vulnerability under pressure**?
  + realtime dos or ddos mitigation, block Ips in firewall, fail2ban, slow-loris attack, close/drop connects reduce ttl, implement ddos via dns, black-hole an ip
  + quarantine a compromised site
  + 
1. **Scenario:** Describe your process for using a **ticketing system** to manage the vulnerability lifecycle in a **staging environment**. How do you prevent vulnerabilities from being reintroduced into production?
  + config as code, modular approach, phased rollout of same config in test/staging to prod. continuous monitor for drift. staging is replica of prod with iac.
