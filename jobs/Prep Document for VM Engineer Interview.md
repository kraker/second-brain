**ðŸ”¹ Vulnerability Management:**

1. Can you explain the **vulnerability management lifecycle**?

* Discovery & identification
  + vuln scans
  + compliance audits
  + pentests
* Assessment & prioritization
  + CVSS scoring
  + Analyze threat vectors
  + Business impact
* Planning & coordination
  + patch
  + workaround
  + accept risk
  + technical controls
* Remediation
  + patch
  + configuration
  + compensating controls
  + reduce surface area if not needed
* Verification
  + re-scan, oscap scan
  + pentest
* Monitoring & reporting
  + ongoing tracking, usually a tool like tenable nessus
  + file integrity monitoring, config drift
  + ongoing scanning to compliance baseline

1. How do you **prioritize vulnerabilities** after a scan?

* Severity, usually CVSS score or in the case of compliance auditing could be CAT I, II, or III
* SLA's:
  + Critical 1-2 weeks
  + High 30 days
  + Medium 90 days
  + Low next maintenance window, maybe not at all depending on analysis
* Analyze threat vectors, is the vuln actually exploitable in our environment?
* Potential business impact? Is business critical infra vulnerable?
* Effort to remediate vs. some other kind of mitigating control
  + balance between potential impact and what's practical

1. How do you **group or categorize vulnerabilities** for remediation?
  + by severity or overall score after analyze with matrix

1. What do you typically do with **scan results**?
  + If results aren't already aggregated in some type of dashboard, they may be exported and imported into something else
  + Export to something like a CSV and run through a custom script or parser
  + If it's part of a piece of devops automation it may be something that's fetched and stored as an artifact in the ci/cd tool

1. How do you verify the **accuracy of findings** across OS, databases, and containers?
  + OS compare to vendor CVE database. Sometimes package version may have security backports but the scanner doesn't pick up on it.
  + Cross reference with database engine documentation, published vulns, etc.
  + Independently corroborate findings with another scanning tool like openscap
  + 
1. What vulnerability **scanning tools** have you used?
  + Tenable Nessus
  + OpenSCAP CLI or Workbench
1. How would you manage vulnerabilities using a **ticketing system** (e.g., ServiceNow)?
  + Jira kanban board, organized by severity
  + Further organized by OS, application, database, infra
  + Or perhaps organized by team
  + Possibly organized by environment (i.e. sandbox, dev, qa/test, prod)
1. How would you **automate vulnerability tracking and remediation**?

ðŸ”¹ Operating System & Infrastructure Security

1. How do you approach **hardening an operating system** and scaling it across environments?
2. What are some common **Linux misconfigurations** youâ€™ve seen, and how did you fix them?
3. Are you familiar with **SUID (Set User ID) and SGID (Set Group ID)**? Why are they security concerns?
4. How do you ensure **OS resilience** against vulnerabilities?

ðŸ”¹ **Kubernetes & Container Security**

1. Can you walk me through the **Kubernetes architecture**?
2. What are the key steps for **hardening Kubernetes clusters** in deployment?
3. How do you secure **container images** and manage vulnerabilities in them?
4. What tools or methods do you use for **container security scanning**?
5. How would you assess and improve the **security posture of a Kubernetes environment**?
6. **Scenario:** How do you manage **separate Kubernetes environments (dev, staging, prod)** across multiple clouds (AWS, Azure, etc.) to ensure consistent security and configuration?
7. **Scenario:** What specific security controls would you implement in a **Kubernetes staging environment** to enforce the principle of least privilege and prevent a breach from spreading to production?

ðŸ”¹ **Cloud & Multi-Cloud Security:**

1. How do you approach **multi-cloud vulnerability management**?
2. What are the challenges of **multi-cloud architecture security**, and how have you addressed them?
3. Describe your experience with **AWS and Azure** in managing vulnerabilities. How would you extend that to other clouds?
4. How do you manage vulnerabilities across different **infrastructure layers** (OS, containers, cloud services)?
5. What is your approach to **cloud security posture management (CSPM)**?

ðŸ”¹ **Compliance & Standards**

1. What is your understanding of **PCI DSS** in the context of vulnerability management?
2. How do compliance requirements influence your **remediation priorities**?

ðŸ”¹ **CI/CD & Automation**

1. How have you integrated **vulnerability scanning and management into CI/CD pipelines**?
2. What automation tools or scripts have you built to support vulnerability management?
3. **Scenario:** Explain how you integrate **container image scanning into your CI/CD pipeline**. Whatâ€™s your process for promoting a securely scanned image from staging to production?

ðŸ”¹ **Behavioral & Communication**

1. Walk me through your **day-to-day responsibilities** in your current or previous role.
2. How do you communicate **vulnerability risks to non-technical stakeholders**?
3. Can you give an example of a time when you had to **handle a critical vulnerability under pressure**?
4. **Scenario:** Describe your process for using a **ticketing system** to manage the vulnerability lifecycle in a **staging environment**. How do you prevent vulnerabilities from being reintroduced into production?
