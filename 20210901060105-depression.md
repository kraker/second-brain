## Notes

### The Depression Cure

_And some things I've added from other sources._

* [TDC - One Pager](thedepressioncure.txt)

Start small. If you don't know where to start, start by [making your bed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxBQLFLei70). 

We didn't evolve to live like we do in the modern world. We evolved to be hunter-gatherers and live in a tribe. 

Diet. Take fish-oil, vitamin D, vitamin C and primrose oil. Consider getting blood work done to  to measure omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid levels. 

Paleo and Keto are probably anti-inflammatory with similar or greater anti-depressant effects to supplementing with fish-oil. Consider changing diet. 

Possibly The Slow Carb Diet is anti-inflammatory and therefore anti-depressant, but perhaps not as potent as full paleo or Keto. This might be worth research, study, or backing up with data or other emperical evidence. Slow Carb still has carbs they're just not as bad as your typical American/Western diet.

Track progress on the depression scale. It's helpful to have a visual queue for progress getting made. 

Get better sleep. 

Jordan Peterson says [get/have a purpose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxBQLFLei70). All the times when I wasn't depressed I felt like I had a purpose with good people around me. Having a purpose is linked with belonging. Belonging is having a [tribe](http://www.sebastianjunger.com/tribe-by-sebastian-junger). Sebastian Junger has more to say on this topic. If I recall times when I felt truly like I had a purpose and belonged were times in my life that were similar to living in a tribal setting.

Manage stress. Exercise helps with this. Stress is just another way of saying anxiety. Possibly consider transcendental meditation. (How do you do transcendental meditation?)
