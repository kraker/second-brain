## Notes

### The Depression Cure

_And some things I've added from other sources._

* [TDC - One Pager](thedepressioncure.txt)

Start small. If you don't know where to start, start by [making your bed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxBQLFLei70). 

We didn't evolve to live like we do in the modern world. We evolved to be hunter-gatherers and live in a tribe. 

Diet. Take fish-oil, vitamin D, vitamin C and primrose oil. Consider getting blood work done to  to measure omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid levels. 

Paleo and Keto are probably anti-inflammatory with similar or greater anti-depressant effects to supplementing with fish-oil. Consider changing diet. 

Possibly The Slow Carb Diet is anti-inflammatory and therefore anti-depressant, but perhaps not as potent as full paleo or Keto. This might be worth research, study, or backing up with data or other emperical evidence. Slow Carb still has carbs they're just not as bad as your typical American/Western diet.

* [The Chemistry of Joy](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Chemistry-of-Joy/Henry-Emmons-MD/9780743265072)

Track progress on the depression scale. It's helpful to have a visual queue for progress getting made. 

Get better sleep. 

Jordan Peterson says [get/have a purpose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxBQLFLei70). All the times when I wasn't depressed I felt like I had a purpose with good people around me. Having a purpose is linked with belonging. Belonging is having a [tribe](http://www.sebastianjunger.com/tribe-by-sebastian-junger). Sebastian Junger has more to say on this topic. If I recall times when I felt truly like I had a purpose and belonged were times in my life that were similar to living in a tribal setting.

Manage stress. Exercise helps with this. Stress is just another way of saying anxiety. Possibly consider transcendental meditation. (How do you do TM?) This probably helps with rumination also. Consider implementing/reading [The Relaxation Response](http://www.relaxationresponse.org/). Jon Kabat-Zinn on [Mindfulness Meditation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nwwKbM_vJc)

* [Mindfullness-based cognitive therapy](https://www.mbct.com/about-mbct/) may be worth further study...
* [/r/meditation - FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/wiki/faq/)
* [Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)](www.goodtherapy.org/Acceptance_Commitment_Therapy.html) may also be helpful for managing stress.
* Take walks in nature.

TDC says not ruminating is just replacing that habit with a different activity. I feel like I might need more than that to go on... but I can research this some more.

Fix dopamine regulation. [Porn Addiction](https://nofap.com/porn-addiction/)

_Overall it seems like the modern world wreaks havoc with our reward systems. Porn, food, media consumption, drugs, alcohol, etc.... it's a real concerted effort to overcome easy access to these things in the modern world._

Remove toxic relationships. I've already removed NPD mom from the picture. The only friends I have left are good people.
