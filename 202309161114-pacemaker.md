# Pacemaker

* Official [Pacemaker Documentation](https://www.clusterlabs.org/pacemaker/doc/)

Start with "Clusters from Scratch". "Pacemaker Administration" is probably good for learning how to manage and do maintenance on clusters that are already built. "Pacemaker Explained" is the exhaustive reference, but it's a bit dry.

* [RHEL 8: Configuring and managing high availability clusters](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/configuring_and_managing_high_availability_clusters/index)

The RHEL documentation is how I learned to build an SAP cluster in RHEL 8. It's pretty good, but doesn't completely explain high level concepts about clustering, or at least not that I was able to grok. 

RHEL uses the `pcs` CLI utility to manage Pacemaker clusters.

* [SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension 15 SP5](https://documentation.suse.com/sle-ha/15-SP5/)

SLES uses the slightly different `crm` utility for Pacemaker cluster management. The syntax is mostly the same as `pcs` but slightly different in some cases. Both have decent CLI help, with `<command> help` so you can usually figure out what you're trying to do if you already know what to look for.
