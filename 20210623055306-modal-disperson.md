**Modal dispersion** is a distortion mechanism occurring in 
[multimode fibers](20210623054703-multi-mode-fiber.md) and other
[waveguides](20210623055746-waveguide.md), in which the signal is spread 
in time because the propagation velocity of the optical signal is not the same 
for all [modes](20210623055932-normal-mode.md). Other names for this 
phenomenon include:
* **multimode distortion**
* **multimode dispersion**
* **modal distortion**
* **intermodal distortion**
* **intermodal dispersion**
* **intermodal delay distortion**
