Stream editor for filtering and transforming text

``` bash
[me@linuxbox ~]$ echo "front" | sed 's/front/back/'
back
```

sed will accept any character that follows the character as the
delimiter.

``` bash
[me@linuxbox ~]$ echo "front" | sed 's_front_back_'
back~
```

Most commands in sed can be preceded by an *address*, specifying which
lines of input streams are to be edited.

``` bash
[me@linuxbox ~]$ echo "front" | sed '1s/front/back/'
back
```
