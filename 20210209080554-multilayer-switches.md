Switches typically work at [Layer 2](20201010184320-layer-2.md) but as
shown in [InterVLAN Routing](20210208085300-intervlan-routing.md)
switches can work at both Layer 2 and [Layer 3](20201010184439-layer-3.md).
* A Layer 3 switch forwards traffic based on IP addresses. 
* Does what a traditional router does using software in hardware.
* To differentiate you can configure a port to be a _switchport_ or a _router_
	_port_.
