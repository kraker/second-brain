A **subnetwork** or **subnet** is a logical subdivision of an 
[IP network](2021-06-15--06-19-15Z--internet_protocol_suite.md). The practice of
dividing a network into two or more networks is called 
[subnetting](2020-10-26--13-45-09Z--subnetting.md).

* Devices in the same subnet share the same _network number_ or _routing prefix_
	+ In technical terms this is known as the 
		[most significant bit](2021-06-27--11-13-50Z--most_significant_bit.md)-group
		in their [IP Addresses](2020-10-10--18-03-22Z--ip_address.md)
	+ In layman terms this can also be considered the 
		[network ID](2020-10-26--12-51-17Z--network_id.md)
* The the second field (_suffix_) is considered the _rest field_ or _host
	identifier_
* The _routing prefix_ may be experessed in 
	[Classless Inter-Domain Routing](2020-10-26--13-43-51Z--cidr.md) (CIDR)
		+ **Example:** `198.51.100.0/24` or `2001:db8::/32`
* For [IPv4](2020-10-21--12-40-14Z--ipv4.md) a network may be characterized by
	its **subnet mask** or **netmask**:
	+ This is the [bitmask](2021-06-27--11-24-14Z--mask_computing.md) that when
		applied by a [bitwise AND](2021-06-27--11-25-37Z--bitwise_operation.md)
		operation to any IP address in the network, yields the _routing prefix_.
		- Usually expressed in [dot-decimal notation](2021-06-27--11-29-34Z--dot-decimal_notation.md). 
			For example: `255.255.255.0` is the subnet mask for the prefix
			`198.51.100.0/24`
