**Content-addressable memory (CAM)** is a special type of [computer memory](20220217112213-computer-memory.md)
used in certain very-high-speed searching applications. 

* Used in [networking devices](20220217112325-networking-device.md) where it
  speeds up [forwarding information base](20220217112444-forwarding-information-base.md)
  and [routing table](2020-11-05--13-33-55Z--routing_tables.md) operations.
* Much faster than [RAM](20220216081431-random-access-memory.md) in data search
  operations
