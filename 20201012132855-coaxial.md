Cable contains central conductor wire surrounded by insulating material and
braided metal shield. This shields data transmission from [EMI](20201012133139-emi.md).

## Connectors

### BNC

*Bayonet-style* connectors called BNC connectors.

* *stick-and-twist*
* **BNC:** Bayonet Neill-Concelman (or British Naval Connector)

### F-type

Typically used in your tv or cable modem.
Screws on.

### Splitter

Splits cable signal into two cables.

### Barrel connectors

Splice two shorter sections of cable together to make one longer section.

## Cable types

### RG-59

Primarily used for cable tv.
*Ohm rating: 75*

### RG-6

More robust. Primarily in used today for data transmission.
*Ohm rating: 75*

### Radio Guide (RG) Rating.

[Ohm](20201012134234-ohm.md) rating. Used to describe impedance and wire's capacitance.

| **Rating** | **Ohms** | **Use**       | **Connector** |
|------------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| RG-58      | 50       | Networking    | BNC           |
