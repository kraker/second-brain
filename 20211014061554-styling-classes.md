* Class names should be written in CamelCase.
* Every class should have a docstring immediately following the class
  definition.
* Use blank lines between methods in a class
* Use 2 blank lines to separate classes
* If you need to import a module from the standard library and a module you
  wrote place the import statement for the standard library module first. Then add
  a blank line, and the import the module you wrote on the next line.
