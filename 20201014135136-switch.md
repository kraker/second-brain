A **network switch** (also called **switching hub**, **bridging hub**, and, by
the [IEEE](20201013131235-networking-industry-standards-ieee.md), **MAC bridge**)
is [networking hardware](20210618061059-networking-hardware.md) that
connects devices on a [computer network](20210610054021-computer-network.md) 
by using [packet switch](20210618061312-packet-switching.md) to
receive and forward data to the destination device.

A network switch is a multiport [network bridge](20210618061512-network-bridge.md)
that uses [MAC addresses](20201009143255-mac.md) to forward data at the 
[data link layer](20201010184320-layer-2.md) (layer 2) of the   
[OSI Model](20201006074200-osi-7-layer.md). Some switches can also forward data
at the [network layer](20201010184439-layer-3.md) (layer 3) by
additionally incorporating [routing](20201105130848-routing.md)
functionality. Such switches are commonly known as layer-3 switches or 
[multilayer switches](20210209080554-multilayer-switches.md).

Switches for [Ethernet](20201012135112-ethernet.md) are the most common
form of network switch.

* Take advantage of [MAC addresses](20201009143255-mac.md) to allow
	devices to communicate directly.
* At first a switch acts like a hub, forwarding all
	[frames](20201009144356-frame.md) to all devices, but quickly creates
	a [source address table](20201016140440-source-address-table.md) (SAT)
	and only forwards to destination MAC addresses.
* Each device connection can run at full network speed.
* [Unicast](20201009144356-frame.md) messages always go only to the intended recipient.
* All broadcast messages go to all ports except origin port.

## Troubleshooting

### Obvious Physical Damage

1. Examine switch for physical damage.
   + Replace any obviously damaged switches.

### Dead Ports

1. look to see if port is flashing
2. If not, try a different port.
3. Try replacing or testing cable.
