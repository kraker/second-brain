# FTP

File Transfer Protocol

-   Protocol: TCP
-   Ports: 21, 20

## [FTP Servers](20201112151106-ftp-servers.md)

## [FTP Clients](20201112151127-ftp-clients.md)

## Active vs Passive

Traditionally FTP requests would go out on port 21 and return on port 20, but if behind a [NAT](20201105142629-network-address-translation.md) this doesn't work so well. So passive FTP only uses port 21.
