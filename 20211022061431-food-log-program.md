I want to create a CLI application that tracks food _transactions_ much like
ledger/hledger does for [plain text accounting](20210905094858-plain-text-accounting.md).

It will need to read and write to a text file. 

It will need to know about where the text file lives. We can setup an
environment variable like hledger does.

## Some examples that already exist

* [hranoprovod-cli](https://github.com/aquilax/hranoprovod-cli)
  + Quantified self tool written in Go

An example of using Ledger to track calories:

* [calories-ledger](https://github.com/rcaputo/calories-ledger)
  + This is the type of usage I envision for this app. For whatever reason using
    method similar to the ledger style of recording food intake just makes sense
    to me.

* [calories](https://github.com/zupzup/calories)
  + Another Go project

## Planning

I'll probably want a config file of some kind with stats like height, weight,
age, etc to calculate BMR (Basic Metabolic Rate?).
