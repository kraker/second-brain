The **remove()** [method](20210915132936-methods.md) removes an item from the
list by it's _value_.

```python
>>> spam = ['cat', 'bat', 'rat', 'elephant']
>>> spam.remove('bat')
>>> spam
['cat', 'rat', 'elephant']
```

* If the item doesn't exist it throws an error.
* If the item appears multiple times only the first occurrence is removed.
