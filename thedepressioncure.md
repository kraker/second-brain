# The Depression Cure - One Pager

## The TLC Protocol

### 1. Measure

Get a baseline and track improvement. Do the [CESD-R](https://cesd-r.com/) once per week and track your score in a spreadsheet to observe trends.

### 2. Supplement

**Omega-3**, **Vitamin D**, and **Vitamin C** supplements once per day:

* **Omega-3**: 1000 mg EPA, 500 mg DHA
* **Vitamin D**: 2000 IU
* **Vitamin C**: 1000 mg

**Evening primrose oil** once per week: 500 mg

### 3. Anti-Ruminate

### 4. Exercise

Buy portable heart rate (HR) monitor for best results. 3 1 hour aerobic workouts per week. Goal is to get 30 minutes of between 60% to 90% of max HR. Can be anything but brisk walking is easiest to start with for most people. Estimate HR max with formula: `220 - age = ?` .

### 5. Light Therapy

Sunlight or light-lamp (SAD lamp). 30 minutes of bright light (10000 lux) within 1 hour of waking. Outside sunlight is only effective at 30 minutes of exposure if it's actually sunny out. Otherwise it takes several hours of being outside on an cloudy/overcast day to have the same therapeutic effect. Get a light box and make it a habit. Supplement with outside sunlight as necessary.
