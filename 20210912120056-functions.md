**Function** (aka _method_) is a user defined _miniprogram_ within a program.
Instead of writing the same code multiple times a function can be defined, and
code-reuse is possible.

Example:

```python
def hello():
    print('Howdy!')

hello()
```

First line is a [def statement](20210912121116-def-statement.md), the code block
following is the [function body](20210912121521-function-body.md) and _hello()_
is a [function call](20210912121301-function-call.md).
