Function calls are stacked one on top of another. When a program calls a
function it stacks that function on top of the program. If that function calls
another function it stacks that function on top of the function that called it.
The program keeps track of the **call stack** and when it reaches the [return
statement](20210912123059-return-statement.md) of any function it returns to
where it was in the previous function or program. 

Example:

```txt
            Pam         
        Bob Bob Bob     Tim  
    Al  Al  Al  Al  Al  Al  Al

```

When programs call a function Python creates a _frame object_ on top of the call
stack. The frame object stores the line number of the original function call.
When a function returns python removes a frame object from the top of the stack
and returns to the line number where the previous function or program left off.
