## Basic Usage

Stream editor for filtering and transforming text

``` bash
[me@linuxbox ~]$ echo "front" | sed 's/front/back/'
back
```

sed will accept any character that follows the character as the
delimiter.

``` bash
[me@linuxbox ~]$ echo "front" | sed 's_front_back_'
back~
```

Most commands in sed can be preceded by an *address*, specifying which
lines of input streams are to be edited.

``` bash
[me@linuxbox ~]$ echo "front" | sed '1s/front/back/'
back
```

## Address Notation

| **Address** | **Description**                                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| n           | A line number where n is a positive integer                               |
| $           | The last line.                                                            |
| *regexp*    | Lines matching a POSIX basic regular expresion.                           |
|             | Note that the regex is delimited by slash characters.                     |
|             | Optionally, the regex may be delimited by an alternate char,              |
|             | by specifying the expression with , where c is alternate.                 |
| addr1,addr2 | A range of lines from addr1 to addr2, inclusive                           |
| first\~step | Match the line represented by the number *first*, then each               |
|             | subsequent line at *step* intervals.                                      |
| addr1,+n    | Match addr1 and the following n lines.                                    |
| addr\!      | Match all lines except addr, which may be any of the forms listed earlier |

## Editing Commands

| **Command**          | **Description**                                                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \=                   | Output the current line number                                   |
| a                    | Append text after the current line                               |
| d                    | Delete the current line                                          |
| i                    | Insert text in front of the current line                         |
| p                    | Print the current line. By default, sed prints every line and    |
|                      | only edits lines that match specified address within the file    |
| q                    | Exit sed without processing any more lines. If the -n option     |
|                      | is not specified, output the current line.                       |
| Q                    | Exit sed without processing any more lines                       |
| s/regex/replacement/ | Substitute the contents of *replacement* wherever *regex*        |
| y/set1/set2          | Transliterate by converting chars from *set1* to chars in *set2* |

sed Basic Editing Commands

## Substitution

sed s/day/night \<old<sub>file</sub> \>new<sub>file</sub> sed
s/day/night old<sub>file</sub> \>new<sub>file</sub> *These both do the
same thing*

echo day | sed s/day/night/

Best practice is to use quotes in case there are meta-characters in the
command. sed 's/day/night/' \<old \>new

### Delimiters

You can use anything as a delimiter as long as it's not in the string
your trying to substitute.

/ and \_ are the most commonly used

sed 's/\\/usr\\/local\\/bin/\\/common\\/bin/' \<old \>new sed
's\_/usr/local/bin\_/common/bin\_' \<old \>new

Some others are : and |

sed 's:/usr/local/bin:/common/bin:' \<old \>new sed
's|/usr/local/bin|/common/bin|' \<old \>new

### Using '&' for Matched String

sed 's/\[a-z\]\*/(&)/' \<old \>new *this puts parentheses around the
matched string*

### Extended Regular Expressions

sed -r echo "123 abc" | sed -r 's/\[0-9\]+/& &/' *Otherwise can't use
the '+'*

### Back-References

Keep the first word and remove the rest. sed 's/\([a-z]*\).\*/\\1/'

echo abcd123 | sed 's/\([a-z]*\).\*/\\1/' *This will output "abcd" and
delete the numbers.*

Can rearrange order of things. sed -r 's/(\[a-z\]+) (\[a-z\]+)/\\2 \\1/'

Can detect duplicated words. sed -rn '/(\[a-z\]+) \\1/p' *This will
print lines containing duplicated words*

You can have up to 9 back-references. Reverse the first 3 characters in
a line. sed 's/^\(.\)\(.\)\(.\)/\\3\\2\\1/'

### Pattern Flags

| **Flag** | **Description**                   |
| -------- | --------------------------------- |
| /g       | Replace all occurrences on a line |
| /        |                                   |
