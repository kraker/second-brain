Similar to [islower()](20210925142308-islower.md) and [isupper()](20210925142111-isupper.md)
there are many **isX()** type methods.

* `isalpha()` Returns True if the string consists only of letters and isnâ€™t blank
* `isalnum()` Returns True if the string consists only of letters and numbers 
  and is not blank
* `isdecimal()` Returns True if the string consists only of numeric characters
  and is not blank
* `isspace()` Returns True if the string consists only of spaces, tabs, and
  newlines and is not blank 
* `istitle()` Returns True if the string consists only of words that begin
  with an uppercase letter followed by only lowercase letters

Note, the isX() methods are helpful for input validation.
