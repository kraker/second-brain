The numeric address where a value is stored can be gotten with the **id()**
function.

```python
>>> id('Howdy')
139712390384112
```

Strings are immutable and if you _change_ a string a new string object is
created in memory.

```python
>>> bacon = 'Hello'
>>> id(bacon)
139712390384240
>>> bacon += ' world!' # A new string is born
>>> id(bacon)
139712390384368 # bacon now refers to a different string
```

Note, Python has _automatic garbage collection_ which deletes any values not
being referred to by any variables to free up memory.
