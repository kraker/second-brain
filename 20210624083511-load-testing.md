**How do you do load testing and capacity planning for web sites?**

> The short answer is: Nobody can answer this question except you.
> 
> The long answer is that benchmarking your specific workload is something that
> you need to undertake yourself, because it's a bit like asking "How long is a
> piece of string?".

**Can you help me with my capacity planning?**

> Benchmark your code on hardware similar to what you'll be using in production,
> identify any bottlenecks, then determine how much of a workload your current
> hardware can handle, and/or how much hardware horsepower you need to handle your
> target workload

## Remediation

Almost always it's just these 2 main options:
1. Scale up:
	+ Bigger server
	+ Moar RAM
	+ Faster disks
2. Scale out:
	+ Get moar servers
