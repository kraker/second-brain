**Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)** is the most recent version of the 
[Internet Protocol](2020-10-10--17-59-03Z--internet_protocol.md) (IP), the
communications protocol that provides an identification and location system for
computers on networks and routes traffic across the
[Internet](2021-06-15--06-38-48Z--internet.md). IPv6 was developed by the
[Internet Engineering Task Force](2020-10-28--17-06-15Z--ietf.md) (IETF) to deal
with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address exhaustion. IPv6 is intended
to replace [IPv4](2020-10-21--12-40-14Z--ipv4.md). In December 1998, IPv6 became
a Draft Standard for the IETF, who subsequently ratified it as an Internet
Standard on 14 July 2017.
