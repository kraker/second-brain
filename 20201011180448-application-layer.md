Combines features of the top 3 layers of [OSI model](20201006074200-osi-7-layer.md).
Each [TCP/IP](20201006074410-tcp-ip-model.md) application uses it's own method.  All [TCP/IP](20201006074410-tcp-ip-model.md) applications are
network aware by default. Standard formats such as MIME are part and parcel with
[TCP/IP](20201006074410-tcp-ip-model.md) protocols.
