In IP-based computer networks, **virtual routing and forwarding (VRF)** is a
technology that allows multiple instances of a routing table to co-exist within
the router at the same time. One or more logical or physical interfaces may have
a VRF and these VRFs do not share routes therefore the packets are only
forwarded between interfaces on the same VRF. VRFs are the [TCP/IP](20201006074410-tcp-ip-model.md)
equivalent of a [VLAN](20210206110741-vlan.md).
