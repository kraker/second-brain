# Multifactor Authentication

Basically having 2 or more access methods as part of the _authentication process_.

## 5 MFA Factors

1. **Something you know**, password or PIN
2. **Something you have**, smartcard, token, or identification device
3. **Something you are**, fingerprints or retinal pattern (biometrics)
4. **Somewhere you are**, location or geolocation
5. **Something you do**, action you must take to complete authentication
