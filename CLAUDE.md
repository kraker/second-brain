# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a personal knowledge management repository containing a Zettelkasten-style note collection, also known as a "second brain" or digital garden. The repository consists of markdown files containing notes on various IT topics including networking, Linux administration, programming, security, and system administration.

## Repository Structure

- **Root directory**: Contains hundreds of markdown files using timestamp-based naming convention (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-topic.md)
- **index.md**: Main landing page for the published notes website
- **old-index.md**: Legacy index page with structured navigation
- **README.md**: Basic repository information and entry points
- **Supporting files**: PDFs, images, and other reference materials

## Note Naming Convention

Notes follow a consistent naming pattern: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-topic-name.md`
- Files are timestamped when created
- Topics are hyphen-separated
- This system supports chronological organization while maintaining topic clarity

## Content Organization

The notes cover a wide range of technical topics:
- Linux/Unix system administration (bash, scripting, package management)
- Networking (TCP/IP, routing, protocols, security)
- Programming languages (Python, bash scripting, various utilities)
- Security and cryptography
- Cloud technologies and DevOps tools
- Database administration
- Web technologies and server management

## Working with This Repository

### Search and Navigation
- Use file search to find specific topics rather than browsing hierarchically
- Common search terms: "bash", "python", "linux", "networking", "security", "ansible"
- Cross-references between notes use the timestamp-based filenames

### Note Structure
- Notes typically contain technical explanations, command examples, and reference information
- Many notes are interconnected through internal links
- Content ranges from brief command references to detailed technical explanations

### Publishing
- Notes are published to a public website at notes.kraker.dev
- The repository serves as both source and backup for the knowledge base
- Author uses Obsidian for note-taking with Git synchronization

## Development Notes

This repository does not contain traditional software development files (no package.json, Makefile, build scripts, etc.). It is purely a documentation and knowledge management system using markdown files.

When working with this repository, focus on:
- Maintaining the existing naming convention for new notes
- Preserving cross-reference links between notes
- Following markdown formatting standards
- Respecting the chronological and topical organization system
