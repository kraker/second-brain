A **security association (SA)** is the establishment of shared security
attributes between two network entities to support secure communication.

The framework for establishing security associations is provided by the
[Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol](20211222062102-internet-security-association-and-key-management-protocol.md) (ISAKMP).

Protocols such as [Internet Key Exchange](20211222062256-internet-key-exchange.md) (IKE)
and [Kerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys](20211222062325-kerberized-internet-negotiation-of-keys.md) (KINK)
provide authentication keying material.
