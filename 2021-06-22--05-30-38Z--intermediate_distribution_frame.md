An **intermediate distribution frame (IDF)** is a [distribution frame](2021-06-22--05-34-48Z--distribution_frame.md) in a central
office or customer premises, which cross connects the user cable media to
individual user line circuits and may serve as a distribution point for
multipair cables from the main distribution frame (MDF) or combined distribution
frame (CDF) to individual cables connected to equipment in areas remote from
these frames.
