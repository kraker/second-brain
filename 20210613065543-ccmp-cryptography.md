**Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol**
**(Counter Mode CBC-MAC Protocol)** or **CCM mode Protocol (CCMP)** is an
encryption protocol designed for Wireless LAN products that implements the
standards of the IEEE 802.11i amendment to the original IEEE 802.11 standard.
CCMP is an enhanced data cryptographic encapsulation mechanism designed for data
confidentiality based upon the Counter Mode with CBC-MAC (CCM mode) of the
[Advanced Encryption Standard](20210203072917-symmetric-key-encryption.md) (AES) standard. 
It was created to address vulnerabilities presented by 
[Wired Equivalent Privacy](20210613070402-wired-equivalent-privacy.md) (WEP), 
a dated, insecure protocol.
