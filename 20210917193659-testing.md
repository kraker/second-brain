Use `echo` statements in place of commands to test

``` bash
if [[ -d $dir_name ]]; then
    if cd $dir_name; then
        echo rm * # TESTING
    else
        echo "cannot cd to '$dir_name'" >&2
        exit 1
    fi
else
    echo "no such directory: '$dir_name'" >&2
    exit 1
fi
exit # TESTING
```

Important to develop and apply good *test* cases.

*edge* and *corner* cases.

1.  dirname contains the name of an existing
    directory
2.  dirname contains the name of a nonexistent
    directory
3.  dirname is empty.
