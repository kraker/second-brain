An **optical fiber connector** terminates the end of an 
[optical fiber](2021-06-18--07-49-11Z--optical_fiber.md), and enables quicker
connection and disconnection than
[splicing](2021-06-18--07-50-15Z--splicing.md). The connectors mechanically
couple and align the cores of fibers so light can pass.  Better connectors lose
very little light due to reflection or misalignment of the fibers. In all, about
100 different types of fiber optic connectors have been introduced to the
market.
