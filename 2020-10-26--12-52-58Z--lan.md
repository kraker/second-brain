A **local area network (LAN)** is a 
[computer network](2021-06-10--05-40-21Z--computer_network.md) that
interconnects computers within a limited area such as a residence, school,
laboratory, university campus or office building. By contrast, a 
[wide area network](2020-10-17--17-08-19Z--wan.md) (WAN) not only covers a
larger geographic distance, but also generally involves 
[leased telecommunication circuits](2021-06-26--07-53-26Z--leased_line.md).

Most common types of LAN currently still in use:
* [Ethernet](2020-10-12--13-51-12Z--ethernet.md)
* [Wi-Fi](2021-06-26--07-55-55Z--wi-fi.md)
