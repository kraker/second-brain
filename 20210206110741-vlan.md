A **virtual LAN (VLAN)** is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and
isolated in a computer network at the [data link layer (OSI layer 2)](20201010184320-layer-2.md).

Enables you to segment a physical network into multiple discreet networks
without having additional hardware.

* Create a VLAN by taking a single physical broadcast domain made up of one or
	more switches and chop it up into multiple broadcast domains.
* Requires switches with specific programming to create the virtual networks.
* Typically a single port will be assinged to a specific VLAN
* Can use multiple switches connected to multiple VLANs through a process called
	[trunking](20210206111413-trunking.md).
