## Bus

All computers connected together in-line or on a *bus*.
*Not fault tolerant*

## Ring

All connected in a loop or *ring*.
*Not fault tolerant*

## Star

All devices connected to a hub
*Fault tolerant*

## Hybrid

Early network systems *shrank* the bus and ring into a box.

### Physical topology

Physically how the network looks.

### Logical topology

Logically how the network functions. (i.e. ring or bus)

### Star-ring and star-bus topologies

Eventually *star-ring* lost market share and now *star-bus* is the predominant
topology in use.

## Mesh

Wireless network topologies.

### Partially Meshed

At least 2 devices have redundant connections.

### Fully Meshed

Every device connects directly to every other device.
