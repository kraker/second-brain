**Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)** is a 
[Control system](2021-06-28--06-01-07Z--control_system.md)
architecture comprising [computers](2021-06-28--06-04-04Z--computer.md), 
networked data communications and 
[graphical user interface](2021-06-28--06-05-43Z--graphical_user_interface.md) (GUI) 
for high-level process supervisory management, while also
comprising other [peripheral](2021-06-28--06-06-46Z--peripheral.md) devices like 
[programmable logic controllers](2021-06-28--06-07-34Z--programmable_logic_controller.md) (PLC)
and discrete 
[proportional-integral-derivative](2021-06-28--06-08-50Z--pid_controller.md) (PID) 
controllers to interface
with process plant or machinery. The use of SCADA has been considered also for
management and operations of project-driven-process in construction.
