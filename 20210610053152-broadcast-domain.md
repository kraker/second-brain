A **broadcast domain** is a logical division of a [computer network](20210610054021-computer-network.md), in which all
nodes can reach each other by broadcast at the data link layer. A broadcast
domain can be within the same LAN segment or it can be bridged to other LAN
segments.

* Any computer connected to the same Ethernet repeater or [Switch](20201014135136-switch.md)
	is a member of the same broadcast domain.
* [Routers](20201010180851-router.md) and other higher-layer devices
	form boundaries between broadcast domains
