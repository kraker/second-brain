# Patch Panel

Most common type of patch panel uses a *110 block*.

-   Use a punchdown tool to push wires into metal-lined grooves.
    -   Metal in the groove slices the cladding enough to make contact with the wire
-   UTP patch panels come with Cat ratings just like UTP cables.

## 66 Block

Used for telecommunications.

-   Same basic installation as 110 block applies.
