CloudLinux is based on RHEL/CentOS. CloudLinux allows for limiting resources for
individual users and security through _CageFS_.

CL is also responsible for these features:
* Python Selector - **cPanel >> Setup Python App**
* Ruby Selector - **cPanel >> Setup Ruby App**

## Installation 

CL is installed almost identical to CentOS for new servers. It's installed over
the top of CentOS 6/7.

### Reqs

* Conversion only works on CE5, CE6, and CE 7. We only use CL on 6 and 7.
* Conversion requires cPanel 11.30 or higher
* Installation requires the purchase of a key. We purchase our keys from cPanel.

### New Install

Existing CE6 kickstarts can be used with the CL ISOs and installation is exactly
the same as with EL6. The ISOs are located here:
http://repo.cloudlinux.com/cloudlinux/6/iso/x86_64/
http://repo.cloudlinux.com/cloudlinux/7/iso/x86_64/

If you're going through DRAC, use the netinstall ISO with a kickstart.
Kickstarts can be generated through SC for any server that's not already setup. 

The following IPs are reserved for kickstarting:
* West: 74.124.211.7 / 255.255.254.0 / 74.124.210.1
* East: 67.199.146.3 / 255.255.255.0 / 67.199.146.1

When you boot the installer, hit the tab key and append the following line after
'initrd.img':
```
linux ks="http://path/to/kickstart" ksdevice=em1 IP=$ip netmask=$mask gateway=$gw dns=8.8.8.8
```

Hit enter.
