| `( )`        | Group tests and operators together to form larger expressions.              |
|              | Since parentheses have special meaning to the shell, must be quoted/escaped |

## Actions

### Predefined

| Action     | Description                                               |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-delete`  | Delete the currently matching file                        |
| `-ls`      | Perform the equivalent of `ls -dils` on the matching file |
| `-print`   | Output the full pathname of the matching file to stdout   |
| `-quit`    | Quit once a match has been made                           |

### User-defined

`-exec command {} ;` `-ok command {} ;` Note: brace and semicolon
have special meaning to the shell and must be quoted Note: the -ok
action in place of -exec will prompt user before execution

```bash
find ~ -type f -name 'foo*' -ok ls -l '{}' ';'
< ls ... /home/me/bin/foo > ? y
-rwxr-xr-x 1 me  me 224 2007-10-29 18:44 /home/me/bin/foo
< ls ... /home/me/foo.txt > ? y
-rw-r--r-- 1 me  me   0 2016-09-19 12:53 /home/me/foo.txt 
```

By changing the trailing ';' to a '+' execute the command on the
whole list of arguments, instead of for each match

```bash
find ~ -type f -name 'foo*' -exec ls -l '{}' +
-rwxr-xr-x 1 me  me 224 2007-10-29 18:44 /home/me/bin/foo
-rw-r--r-- 1 me  me   0 2016-09-19 12:53 /home/me/foo.txt
```
