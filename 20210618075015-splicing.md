A mechanical splice is a junction of two or more [optical fibers](20210618074911-optical-fiber.md)
that are aligned and held in place by a self-contained assembly (usually the
size of a large carpenter's nail). The fibers are not permanently joined, just
precisely held together so that [light](20210618075147-light.md) can
pass from one to another.
