* Has no connection to [PPP](20210205061226-ppp.md)
* Uses UDP or TCP port 88
* Authentication protocol for TCP/IP networks with many clients all connected to
	a single authentication server.
* Cornerstone of Microsoft Windows domain
	+ Defers all authentication to a domain controller, usually a Windows server. 
* Key Distribution Center (KDC)
	+ Authentication Server (AS)
	+ Ticket-Granting Service (TGS)
	+ In a Windows server env, this is installed on the _domain controller_
	+ Process:
		1. Clients sends hash of username and password to the _AS_
		2. The _AS_ compares the results of that hash to its own hash
		3. If they match, sends Ticket-Granting Ticket (TGT) and timestamp
			- In Windows the ticket has a default lifespan of 10 hours
		4. The client sends the _TGT_ to the _TGS_ for authorization
		5. The _TGS_ sends a timestamped service ticket. (AKA access token)
			- The token is the key the client uses to access any single resource on
				the entire domain. 
			- Contains the _security identifier (SID)_ for the user's account and SIDs
				for the groups of which the user is a member.
			- Timestamping forces client to request new token every 8 hours. This
				prevents 3rd parties from intercepting the tokens and attempting to
				crack them. 
* Weaknesses
	+ If _KDC_ goes down, no one has access.
		- Important to have a backup KDC
	+ Timestamping requires all clients and servers synchronize their clocks
		- Difficult on dispersed networks
