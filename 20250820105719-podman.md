## Common podman commands and paths:

```bash
podman build -t imageName -f ContainerFile .  # Build an image from a ContainerFile
podman exec -it runningContainer /bin/bash    # Attach to a running container and execute a bash shell to use to run commands
podman login registry.domain.tld              # Login to a registry
podman info                                   # Get system info about podman like registries
podman inspect imageName                      # Inspect a local image
skopeo inspect docker://registry/namespace/image  # Inspect a remote image
podman ps                                     # List running images
podman ps -a                                  # List all images running or not
podman pull registry/namespace/image          # "Pull" an image from a registry
podman run                                    # Run an image, will also attempt to pull the image if it isn't already
podman run -dt imagName                       # Run an image "detached" with a "tty"
podman run -it imageName                      # Run an image and attach to the tty, only useful if container runs a shell
podman run -it imageName /bin/sh              # Run an image, attach to a tty running /bin/sh. More useful...
podman search imageName                       # Search for image with "imageName" in the configured registries
/etc/containers/registries.conf               # Default registries config
```

How do I get a list of currently configured registries?

```bash
podman info | grep -A5 ^registries:
```

## Rootful vs Rootless

Containers can have root privs or not have. Rootless is better for security.

## Podman vs. Docker

Containers can be run by ordinary users that do not need any elevated privileges. Containers run in user namespace.
