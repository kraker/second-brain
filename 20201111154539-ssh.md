# Secure Shell (SSH)

Allows a terminal or client to connect to a host terminal with data encrypted as it traverses the network.

* Protocol: TCP
* Port: 22
* Replaced [telnet](20201111154514-telnet.md)
* SSH servers use [public-key cryptography](20220419094714-public-key-cryptography.md) and [challenge-response authentication](20220419114857-challenge-response-authentication.md).

## Process:
1. Server sends public key to client
2. After the client receives the key, it creates a session ID and encrypts it
	 with the public key.
3. The server decrypts the session ID and uses it in all data transfers going
	 forward. 
	 - Only the server and client know the session ID
4. SSH server requests username and password to authenticate the client.
	 - In addition to usernames and passwords, SSH servers can also use public
		 keys to identify clients. A pair of RSA or DSA (Digital Signature
		 Algorithm) keys are created and the public key is copied to the server.
