# Music Production

## Tools

* [DAW](20231126074700-daw.md)

## Learning

* [How to Make EDM](https://www.edmprod.com/how-to-make-electronic-music/)

## Minimally Viable Studio

* Computer - MacBook Pro M1 or M2. Windows has issues with Ableton. Not as many good DAWs for Linux...
* DAW - Ableton Live (Most popular for those starting out)
* Headphones - Sony MDR7506 ... good value starting out. Won't break the bank...

### Misc.

* Andy V. uses REAPER for a DAW
* Recommends [DSK Music](https://www.dskmusic.com/) for sourcing drum kits
