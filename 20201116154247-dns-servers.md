# DNS Servers

A DNS server is a computer running DNS server software.
* Protocols: Primarily UDP but sometimes TCP
* Port: 53

## Root Servers 
* DNS starts with a '.'
* Delegates name resolution to other DNS servers

## Top-Level Domain (TLD) Servers 
* These are all the '.com' '.org' '.net' '.edu' '.gov', etc.
* [ICANN](20201116155024-icann.md) has the authority to create new TLDs.

## Second-Level DNS Servers 
Handle millions of names like totalsem.com, alexkraker.net, etc

## [Name Servers](20201117152350-name-servers.md)

## [DNS Zone](20201117152732-zone.md)
* [Foward Lookup Zone](2021-02-02--06-56-38Z--foward_lookup_zone.md.md)
	Where IPs and FQDNs for the devices in a domain are stored.
* [Reverse Lookup Zone](2021-02-02--07-15-25Z--reverse_lookup_zone.md.md)
* **Cached Lookups**
	Previously resolved [FQDN](20201117152114-fqdn.md)'s are _cached_.

## Configuration
* **Authoritative**
	Store IP addresses and FQDN's of systems for a particular domain or domains.
* **Cache-only**
	Never the authoritative nameserver. Communicate with other DNS servers to 
	resolve domains.

## [DNS Records](20201117152831-dns-record.md) 

## Location of DNS Servers 
* **Local**
	+ Usually private DNS
	+ Typically forwards DNS for which it's not the authoritative nameserver
* **External**
	Any DNS server that is not internal to an organization.

## Dynamic DNS 
Works together with [DHCP](2020-10-21--13-18-28Z--dhcp.org) to
dynamically update IP addresses of forward lookup zones
* IPAM
	**IP Address Management Protocol** used to establish DNS when IP addresses
	change. Used to communicate between DHCP and DNS server.
