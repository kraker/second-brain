**Asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL)** is a type of 
[digital subscriber line](20210624052135-digital-subscriber-line.md)
(DSL) technology, a data communications technology that enables faster data
transmission over [copper](20210624052925-copper.md) 
[telephone lines](20210624052343-telephone-line.md) than a conventional 
[voiceband](20210624053205-voice-frequency.md) [modem](20210624053253-modem.md)
can provide. ADSL differs from the less common 
[symmetric digital subscriber line](20210624053442-symmetric-digital-subscriber-line.md)
(SDSL). In ADSL [bandwidth](20210622062329-bandwidths.md) and 
[bit rate](20210624053730-bit-rate.md) are said to be asymmetric, 
meaning greater toward the customer premisis 
([downstream](2021-06-24--05-38-56Z--downstream_networking.md)) than the reverse
([upstream](20210624054027-upstream-networking.md)).
