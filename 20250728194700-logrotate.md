# Logrotate

* Timer: `logrotate.timer`
* Service: `logrotate.service`
* Config files:
  + `/etc/logrotate.conf`
  + `/etc/logrotate.d/`

Force a rotation of logs:

```bash
logrotate --force /etc/logrotate.conf
```

Logrotate doesn't compress by default, but compression is relatively low cpu cost on modern systems. This author likes to compress logs by default by uncommenting line:

```txt
# uncomment this if you want your log files compressed
#compress
```

```bash
sed -i 's/^#compress/compress/' /etc/logrotate.conf
```
