When looking at study materials, resources, and guides look at information
density. Video/audio has low information density at 1x speed compared to text or
pictures. In lieu of text, it's better to be able to speed up video more than 1x
speed. 

Hands-on labs are essential for me to be able to learn. An effective lab puts
things in context and approximates _the real thing_ as closely as possible.

Small wins are important to build momentum, especially in the beginning.

Learning acronyms via Anki isn't as effective as I would have hoped. 

Being able to visualize a space is much like being able to use the _house_
method to memorize things. Being able to walk yourself visually through a 3D
space in your mind is 100x more effective than just learning stuff by rote. :w

## WordPress fix

Error:
```
Your installation of WordPress prompts for FTP credentials to perform updates. (Your site is performing updates over FTP due to file ownership. Talk to your hosting company.)
```

Research shows that Virtualmin should be using suexec by default. And it is.
Ideally this means that Apache and PHP scripts are running as the owner of the
PHP scripts, or that user, but they aren't. Not sure why... but changing the
file-perms and ownership with this script did the trick:

Note user and group are both now `www-data:www-data` and not `kraker:kraker`.
