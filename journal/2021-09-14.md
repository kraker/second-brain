Notes should be atomic.

I need a way to capture fleeting notes.

Write notes in my own words. If I write them in my own words it means I've
processed and understood the information enough to write them in my own words.

The act of writing the note forces me to process the information enough so that
I understand it, probably better than if I just read it. 

If I understand it well enough I may not need to refer to my notes later if I
_learned_ it. But if I don't write the note I probably won't learn it as well.
