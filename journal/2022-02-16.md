Getting a degree at some point is good _career insurance_ if I want to keep
working in IT long-term. It's worth considering trying to finish my bachelors.

I may reach a ceiling where certain advanced technical roles are closed to me
because I don't have a degree.

The exception to this is if I pivot and end up becoming an entrepreneur. 

It's worth thinking about what the best path forward for me might be.
