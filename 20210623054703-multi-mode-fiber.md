**Multi-mode optical fiber** is a type of [optical fiber](20210618074911-optical-fiber.md)
mostly used for communication over short distances, such as within a building or
campus. Multi-mode links can be used for data rates up to 100 Gbit/s. Multi-mode
fiber has a fairly large core diameter that enables multiple light 
[modes](20210623055932-normal-mode.md) to be propagated and limits the 
maximum length of a transmission link because of
[modal disperson](20210623055306-modal-disperson.md).
