**Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol**
* Automatically assigns an [IP address](2020-10-10--18-03-22Z--ip_address.md) whenever a device connects to the network.

## Ports/Protocols
Uses [UDP](2020-10-11--17-36-54Z--udp.md) ports 67 and 68
* Sending: 67
* Receiving: 68

## DHCP relays
On larger networks with multiple LANs sometimes it's necessary to relay DHCP broadcasts through to the central DHCP server. [Routers](2020-10-10--18-08-51Z--router.md) block DHCP broadcasts by default.

## IP reservation
Can configure DHCP servers to reserve certain IPs in use as static IPs on some machines

## MAC Reservations
Rarely used, but sometimes it makes more sense to have the same MAC address always associated with the same IP.

## No DHCP Server

### Troubleshooting
1.  Try to re-establish lease manually
    Windows: `ipconfig /release`
    	 `ipconfig /renew`
    Mac:     `sudo ifconfig eth0 down`
    	 `sudo ifconfig eth0 up`
    Linux:   `sudo dhclient -r`
    	 `sudo dhclient`

## Multiple DHCP Servers
Usually in a failover configuration.

## Rogue DHCP Server
A DHCP server is added to the network and is giving out incorrect IP addresses. Often this is either a user brings in a router from home and plugs it into the network or it's a malicious actor that has gained access to the network.
