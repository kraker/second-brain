**for** loops use the [range()](20210911122111-range-function.md) function and
iterate over whatever items are in the _range_. for loops can also iterate over
items in a list.

for statement: `for i in range(n):`

for loops contain the following:

* The _for_ keyword
* A variable name
* The _in_ keyword
* A call to the _range()_ method with up to 3 integers passed to it
* A colon
* Starting on a newline, an indented _for clause_

## Examples

```python
print('My name is')
for i in range(5):
    print('Jimmy Five Times (' + srt(i) + ')')
```

Equivalent [while](20210911083636-while-loop-statements.md) loop:

```python
print('My name is')
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print('Jimmy Five Times (' + str(i) + ')')
    i = i + 1
```

Calculate the sum of all numbers between 1 and 100 using a _for_ loop:

```python
total = 0
for num in range(101):
    total = total + num
print(total)
```

### Iterate over list items

```python
>>> supplies = ['pens', 'staplers', 'flamethrowers', 'binders']
>>> for item in supplies:
...     print(item)
...
pens
staplers
flamethrowers
binders
>>> for i in range(len(supplies)):
...     print('Index ' + str(i) + ' in supplies is: ' + supplies[i])
...
Index 0 in supplies is: pens
Index 1 in supplies is: staplers
Index 2 in supplies is: flamethrowers
Index 3 in supplies is: binders
>>>
```

Note: how you can iterate over the `range(len(someList))` to get the indexes of
a list.
