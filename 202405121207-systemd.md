# systemd

The service manager on most modern Linux distributions. Systemd is the very first process that starts after the kernel is loaded, and it takes care of starting all other processes and services on a Linux system.

## unit

An item that is managed by Systemd. Different types of units exist:

```bash
[root@rocky9 ~]# systemctl -t help
Available unit types:
service
mount
swap
socket
target
device
automount
timer
path
slice
scope
```

### Overview of units & targets

_systemctl_ overview commands:

| Command                                 | Description                                               |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `systemctl -t service`                  | Shows only service units                                  |
| `systemctl -t target`                   | Show current loaded active targets                        |
| `systemctl get-default`                 | Show default boot target                                  |
| `systemctl set-default <target>`        | Set default boot target                                   |
| `systemctl list-units -t service`       | Shows all active service units (same as previous command) |
| `systemctl list-units -t service --all` | Shows all inactive & active service units                 |
| `systemctl --failed -t service`         | Shows all failed service units                            |
| `systemctl status -l <name>.service`    | Shows detailed status information about a service         |

### Unit dependencies

Find out which dependencies a unit has:

```bash
systemctl list-dependencies <unitname>
```

Find out which units are required for this unit to be started:

```bash
systemctl list-dependencies <unitname> --reverse
```

### Print existing unit file

```bash
systemctl cat <unitname>
```

### Unit options

Show available unit options:

```bash
systemctl show
# or
systemctl show <unitname>
```

### Editing units

```bash
systemctl edit <unitname>
```

### Reload systemd units

Reload systemd unit files after editing or making changes:

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
```

## target

In Systemd, a collection of unit files that can be managed together.

### Set default boot target

Check current default boot target:

```bash
[root@rhel9-a ~]# systemctl get-default
multi-user.target
```

Set default boot target:

```bash
systemctl set-default multi-user
```

### halt, poweroff, reboot, and shutdown

`halt`, `poweroff`, `reboot`, and `shutdown` are systemd targets in later versions of RHEL. They're symbolic links to `systemctl`.

```bash
[root@rhel9-a ~]# ll /usr/sbin/{halt,poweroff,reboot,shutdown}
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 16 Apr  8 11:53 /usr/sbin/halt -> ../bin/systemctl
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 16 Apr  8 11:53 /usr/sbin/poweroff -> ../bin/systemctl
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 16 Apr  8 11:53 /usr/sbin/reboot -> ../bin/systemctl
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 16 Apr  8 11:53 /usr/sbin/shutdown -> ../bin/systemctl
```

## want

An indication for a Systemd unit file that is supposed to be started from a specific Systemd target. 

```
...
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

If a service is _enabled_ it's a symlink in a directory of the _target name_ so that Systemd knows to start the service as part of that group of _units_.

```bash
[root@rocky9 ~]# systemctl enable vsftpd
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/vsftpd.service â†’ /usr/lib/systemd/system/vsftpd.service.
```

> In Systemd terminology, this symbolic link is known as a _want_, as it defines what the target wants to start when it is processed.
