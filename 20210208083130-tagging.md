Allows a [frame](20201009144356-frame.md) to get to the destination
machine with muliple [switches](20201014135136-switch.md) and [VLANs](20210206110741-vlan.md) in a network.
* The VLAN port tags an incoming frame.  
* If the destination device is connected to the same switch, the frame is sent
	directly to the device's access port.
* If the destination device connects to a different switch the initial switch
	sends the frames out its _trunk_ port.
	+ Trunk ports connect to other trunk ports on other switches and allow
		switches to relay packets between switches.
	+ If the trunk port has a native VLAN that differes from the tag placed on the
		frame as it entered the access port, the switch leaves the tag on the frame
		and send the tagged frame to the next switch.
	+ If the trunk port's native VLAN is the same as the access port's VLAN, then
		the switch drops the tag and sends the untagged frame out the trunk port. 
* Native VLANs
	+ Exist to provide compatibility with older/simpler non-VLAN tagging switches.
	+ Opens network to a _double-tagging attack_
	+ Modern networks set the native VLAN to an unused VLAN and the trunk port is
		configured to tag its native VLAN traffic also.
