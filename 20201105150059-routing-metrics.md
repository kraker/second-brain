This is a relative value that routers use when they have more than one route to get to another network. The lowest value is always used.

# Metric Setting Criteria

## Hop count

The number of routers a packet will pass through on the way to its destination

## Bandwidth

Uses bandwidth limitations to determine routing metric

## Delay

Uses latency to determine routing metric

## Cost

Uses various cost analysis such as low bandwidth to establish routing metric
