In computer networking, a link-local address is a network address that is valid
only for communications within the network segment or the [broadcast domain](20210610053152-broadcast-domain.md) 
that the host is connected to. Link-local addresses are most often assigned
automatically with a process known as **stateless address autoconfiguration** or
**link-local address autoconfiguration**, also known as **automatic private IP
addressing (APIPA)** or **auto-IP**.
