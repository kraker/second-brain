Array variables are created automatically when they are accessed

``` bash
[me@linuxbox ~]$ a[1]=foo
[me@linuxbox ~]$ echo ${a[1]}
foo
```

Arrays can also be created with the `declare` command. `declare -a a`

Arrays can also be created at the same time as values are values are
added `days=(Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat)` Note: can specify indexes
`days=([0]=Sun [1]=Mon [2]=Tue [3]=Wed [4]=Thu [5]=Fri [6]=Sat)`
