A **broadcast domain** is a logical division of a [computer network](2021-06-10--05-40-21Z--computer_network.md), in which all
nodes can reach each other by broadcast at the data link layer. A broadcast
domain can be within the same LAN segment or it can be bridged to other LAN
segments.

* Any computer connected to the same Ethernet repeater or [Switch](2020-10-14--13-51-36Z--switch.md)
	is a member of the same broadcast domain.
* [Routers](2020-10-10--18-08-51Z--router.md) and other higher-layer devices
	form boundaries between broadcast domains
