A **modulator-demodulator**, or simply a **modem**, is a 
[hardware](2021-06-24--05-44-10Z--computer_hardware.md) device that converts
data from a digital format, intended for communication directly between devices
with specialized wiring, into one suitable for a 
[transmission medium](2021-06-24--05-46-07Z--transmission_medium.md) such as
telephone lines or radio. A modem [modulates](2021-06-22--06-16-54Z--modulated.md)
one or more [carrier wave](2021-06-22--06-15-59Z--carrier_wave.md) signals to
encode [digital information](2021-06-24--05-13-37Z--digital_data.md) for
transmission, and [demodulates](2021-06-24--05-49-22Z--demodulation.md) signals
to decode the transmitted information. The goal is to produce a
[signal](2021-06-24--05-52-43Z--signal.md) that can be transmitted easily and
decoded reliably to reproduce the original digital data.
