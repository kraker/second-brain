_Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol_
Combined [PPTP](20210206101803-pptp-vpn.md) and the Cisco protocol
_Layer 2 Fowarding (L2F)_ and added support to run on almost any connection
possible. 
* Cisco provides free client software to connect a single remote device to a
	Cisco VPN.
* Creates a typical _host-to-site_ or _client-to-site_ connection
* Often two Cisco VPN concentrators will connect two separate
	[LANs](20201026125258-lan.md) permanently.
	+ It's slow but inexpensive compared to a dedicated high-speed connection
		between two faraway LANs.
