**Differentiated services** or **DiffServ** is a 
[computer networking](2021-06-10--05-40-21Z--computer_network.md) architecture
that specifies a simple and scalable mechanism for classifying and managing
network traffic and providing [Quality of service](2021-06-26--10-09-35Z--quality_of_service.md) 
on modern [IP](2020-10-10--17-59-03Z--internet_protocol.md) networks.

* Can provide low-latency to voice or streaming media
* While providing simple _best-effort_ service to non-critical services

DiffServ uses a 6-bit **differentiated services code point (DSCP)** in the 8-bit
**differentiated services field (DS field)** in the [IP header](2020-10-21--12-51-45Z--ip_header.md) 
for [packet](2020-10-10--18-24-24Z--packet.md) classification purposes.
