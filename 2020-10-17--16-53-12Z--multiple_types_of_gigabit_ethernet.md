You can use dedicated *media converters* to connect any type of Ethernet cabling
together.

## Gigabit Interface Converter (GBIC)

Standard modular port to convert various types of Ethernet

## Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP)

Much smaller transceiver but same as GBIC in the sense that hot-swappable and
support all same networking standards.
