**Differentiated services** or **DiffServ** is a 
[computer networking](20210610054021-computer-network.md) architecture
that specifies a simple and scalable mechanism for classifying and managing

on modern [IP](20201010175903-internet-protocol.md) networks.

* Can provide low-latency to voice or streaming media
* While providing simple _best-effort_ service to non-critical services

DiffServ uses a 6-bit **differentiated services code point (DSCP)** in the 8-bit
**differentiated services field (DS field)** in the [IP header](20201021125145-ip-header.md) 
for [packet](20201010182424-packet.md) classification purposes.
