[WAN](20201017170819-wan.md)s are interconnected
[LAN](20201026125258-lan.md)s. To differentiate LANs each device on a
single LAN must share a very similar, but not identical, 
[IP Address](20201010180322-ip-address.md).

* Network ID is an IP address ending in 0
  + Can cover larger range of IPs, but having more 0s. 172.0.0.0 for example.
* All device IPs on LAN can't end in 0, but share same first octet.
  + i.e. 202.120.10.x
